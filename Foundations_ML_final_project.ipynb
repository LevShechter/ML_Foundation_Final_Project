He has lived up to the promise that book offered glimpses of with his newest book, Texas Two-Step. This is a fast paced, wild ride through a drug deal with double crossings, crooked cops, and relationships which are frayed and strained.\\\\nWhen Cooper discovers he is about to become a proud father, he is forced to confront the fact the life of following bands around, taking and dealing drugs, and basically living for the moment, need to come to an end. Instead of making a quick exit from that life, he elects to procure one more big weed deal to unload the high-grade strain he has been growing. Going against his better judgement, and the advice of his best friend and partner Davis, he reaches out to an old connection, Sancho. Dealing with Sancho has always meant dealing with additional headaches and baggage, but this time Sancho also brings with him a former NFL bust who is looking to pull a double cross, a crooked sheriff who puts profit above serving the public good, and a pair of law enforcers who are looking to put Sancho, and by extension Cooper and Davis, away for good.\\\\nThis book is about friendship and growing up for the good of all you love and hold dear. But it is also about chasing one last big score, staying ahead of the threats nipping at your heels, and most importantly, keeping the reader invested until the final pages.\\\\nPool is set to put the reading world on notice with this one. While not as pulpy as Debt Crusher, he shows he can juggle multiple story lines and flesh out his characters with a keen eye. This book is a hell of a ride and will have you excited about, not only the ending of this book, but the future of Pool. He is poised to make some noise in the noir landscape.

Most of us still consider lighting in our home as a collection of lamps that produce light. But a collection of lamps doesn\\\\u2019t necessarily create good lighting. Innr isn\\\\u2019t about lamps. It\\\\u2019s about great lighting, for every moment and every activity in your home.\\\\nEver wondered how all those glossy interior design magazines manage to showcase these beautiful homes with the lighting just right?\\\\nEver been put off by the price of a professional lighting plan?\\\\nAt Innr we believe every home deserves great lighting at every moment of the day. It\\\\u2019s why we\\\\u2019re here: to make great lighting accessible to everyone. Outside you\\\\u2019ve got the sun, inside you\\\\u2019ve got Innr.\\\\nIndicate where the room\\\\u2019s fixed features are, such as doors and windows.\\\\nAdd your furniture and any beautiful belongings you\\\\u2019d like to accentuate.\\\\nand you have your personalised lighting plan. As well as all the products you need to make it happen, ready to be delivered to your home.\\\\nOnce your order has arrived you\\\\u2019re ready for step two. Installation is quick and easy with the personalised lighting plan of your room and the contents of your order: state-of-the-art Innr LED spots, easy-to-install strips and bulbs, an internet bridge, and everything else needed to achieve the transformation of your room.\\\\nWith the installation complete, you\\\\u2019re ready for the final step. After logging into your Innr account via the app on your smart device, you\\\\u2019ll be shown tailor-made settings for different moods and activities, based on the personal lighting plan created for your room.\\\\nWith a single screen tap you can adjust the lighting to fit your current mood or activity. For dining, relaxing, having friends round, working from home or doing homework with the kids. Innr provides great lighting for everything you do, including when you\\\\u2019re doing nothing much and just want to relax.\\\\nWhat started with a vision to empower people to be able to create better lighting at home, has now materialized into fully functional software and prototypes that are ready for mass production.\\\\nThe online lighting advisor has undergone numerous iterations and reviews with consumers and lighting designers to make sure that the interface is simple and the advice is top notch. We\\\\u2019re happy with the results so we plan to release a beta version next month.\\\\nWe\\'ve built many prototypes of the lighting products so we can be sure they deliver the lighting quality and ease of installation we promise. The designs have been finalized and the first tools have been ordered. We\\'ve been really fortunate to be able to work with an international team of outstanding design partners and suppliers who have thought with us every step of the way, using their experience gained from working for leading lighting and electronics brands.\\\\nIn four months\\' time we expect to deliver the first orders. While we continue to tweak the software, the biggest step now is to order tooling, start production and go through certification so that we can start shipping. Meanwhile we are working on brand development, marketing positioning, packaging, and all the other of other major details that are needed to bring Innr to life.\\\\nWe\\\\u2019ve come a long way over the past year with the creation of Innr. We think it will revolutionize the way people light their homes. Your support will allow us to order tools and start up production so that we can make Innr available to you and everyone interested in personalised great lighting. More importantly, as part of the Kickstarter community, you\\'ll not only be supporting us with crowd funding, but also with great ideas and feedback to help make Innr even better. We\\\\u2019re keen to receive your sharp and insightful reviews. The claim we make is a substantial one, and we really want Innr to live up to it. Use it, test it, give us your thoughts.\\\\nAn international bunch who all believe in the magical power of light to enrich homes and interiors. Our vision and passion lie in the desire to change the way people experience lighting.\\\\nWe\\\\u2019re delighted to be able to share the Innr journey with you, and hope you\\\\u2019ll join us in our mission to change the way people think about lighting. Help us make great, personalised lighting for every moment of the day available to everyone. And please check www.innr.com or..\\\\nThere are always plenty of pitfalls and hurdles to overcome when truly innovating. Innr, with its technical complexity, has been no exception. The good news is that some of the biggest risks on our journey in creating Innr now lie behind us.\\\\nWe\\'ve had to develop software that can provide sound lighting advice and the results we believe in. We also wanted to develop top quality led products that are smaller than anything available on the market. To top it all, we wanted to develop a reliable wireless control system that could be programmed through the lighting advisor. We\\'re proud to say we managed to achieve all of our objectives. Innr has been created thanks to a great team with the right experience and ambition and first-class suppliers who are ready to get going with manufacturing Innr for us.\\\\nIn the next phase the main risks are in production delays, release test hiccups and software bugs. For the most typical risks, we have identified ways to minimize them and to resolve them if they should crop up. Nevertheless, you can never eliminate sheer bad luck. So we\\\\u2019ve allowed for some slack in the production planning, if only to reinforce in our own belief that we\\\\u2019ll be able to deliver on time.\\\\nTHANKS a lot for your support. We love you too. And by the way, you look great today!\\\\nGet a first glimpse of what Innr can do for you: 2 classic bulbs and a remote for easy and convenient control. Who was it again that said: \\'Every great journey begins with a first step\\'?\\\\nExperience the difference it will make to your books, and the room they\\\\u2019re in.\\\\nPimp your \\\\u2018traditional fixtures\\\\u2019, that treasured designer lamp or those old things you scored on the flea market.\\\\nEnjoy the changes Innr can make, highlighting and lowlighting parts of your interior to fit with what you\\\\u2019re doing (or not doing).\\\\nYou will truly feel the magic power of light and the contribution to your well-being.\\\\nYou get the Complete Lighting Kit, plus real-time personal lighting guidance from one of our trained light advisors. Yeehaa!\\\\nYour budget for a complete lighting solution: a tailored set of products to fully satisfy your personal wishes and requirements in your home.

              " '{\"text\": \"\\\\\"It can be towed by a mid-sized car, van or pickup truck\\\\\"\\\\nIt is smaller and generally lighter than a Fifth Wheel Trailer, which means it can be towed by a mid-sized car, van or pickup truck (this could mean using a lot less fuel to get where you are going).\\\\nDepending on the model you buy or rent, you will have all the comforts of home. Unlike the Fiver (Fifth Wheel Trailer) these trailers have a single level floor plan. If you are looking for a reasonable amount of living space at a reasonable cost than this is the RV for you.\\\\nMost Travel Trailers are fully self-contained for camping out in the boonies. They can also be equipped with room slideouts that increases the size of available living space when camped (more room for dogs, cats, kidlets, grandchildren or you). The length of these RVs vary between 8 to 35 ft.\\\\nIf your motto is \\\\\"have toys will travel\\\\\" then this trailer is for you. A Toy Hauler is a Trailer or Fifth Wheel that has been designed to carry your toys such as quads, dirt bikes, dune buggies, your favorite Harley or even a small car.\\\\nThey have a big back door that doubles as a ramp. Your toys are stored in a mini-garage behind the main living area of the trailer.\\\\nOnce you are at your camp sight and you have removed all of your toys, these mini-garages can be converted to useable living space such as a bedroom, etc. (this depends on the model you have).\\\\nThese special trailers can have up to 3 axles dependant on the weight they are designed to carry.\\\\nThe name of this trailer pretty much describes its appearance it looks like a small teardrop. These little trailer\\'s roots goes back to the 1930s when they were very popular.\\\\nEarly in the 1960s their popularity started to decline, due to the availability of larger trailers and Motorized RVs. However in the last few years there has been a renaissance (I have always wanted to use this word in a sentence) in the Teardrop Trailer category.\\\\nQuite a few hobbyists have bought some of these old trailers and restored them back to their original condition.\\\\nThere are even kits that are available so that you can build your own tiny Teardrop Trailer (if you are handy with tools and have a lot of time on your hands you can give this a try).\\\\nOne important fact to remember is that these trailers are SMALL. They range from 8 to 10 feet in length and 4 to 5 feet in heighth (ideal for a small couple). Needless to say this is not ideal for a family of four.\\\\nThere are even Teardrop Trailer Rallies, where all of the Teardroppers (I just made that name up maybe it will stick) get together at Teardrop rallies to show off their tiny trailers.\\\\nTake a look at the video we recently shot for EARV to demonstrate how easy it is to setup Expandable (Hybrid) Travel Trailers.\\\\nWe would like to thank Bill Durkee from CustomRV inc. located in Anaheim California for conducting this great demonstration for us.\\\\nThese are also known as Hybrid Trailers. These unique trailers are a cross between a normal Trailer and a Tent Trailer.\\\\nIn order to create more sleeping space these trailers have pop-out ends or sides like a Tent Trailer.\\\\nDon\\'t confuse this with a room slideout. Room slideouts have solid walls and ceilings, the pop-out has canvas walls and ceilings like a Tent Trailer.\\\\nThese pop-outs allow these RVs to comfortably sleep up to 8 people in a modest sized trailer. Some of these pop-outs are configured with bunk beds, creating even more sleeping space.\\\\nNow you will have no excuse for not inviting all of your relatives to go camping with you.\\\\nThe Expandable trailer is less expensive than a similar sized trailer with room slideouts.\\\\nHopefully, the above information will be helpful in steering you in the right direction.\\\\nIf you have decided that a Trailer is the right type of RV for you, you should now head over to the Buying a RV section of this web site to get some more helpful hints.\"}\\n',\n",

Her sister raced across the dusty path in pursuit. The two spiraled into a pile of dried leaves, laughing gleefully. A gentle breeze wisped through their hair and carried leaves across the sky. The two watched as the leaves twirled about and swept passed the spotted zetraloid in the distance.\\\\n\\\\u201cWhat\\\\u2019s he doin\\\\u2019?\\\\u201d Speckle asked her sister.\\\\nThe two sisters raced up the slope. The dust patted out beneath their feet as they frolicked and ran. Tall yellowing grass lined the sides of their path while a lone apple tree waited at the top of the hill along with the small zetraloid.\\\\n\\\\u201cDomino, come play with us!\\\\u201d Speckle nudged the spotted zetraloid affectionately.\\\\n\\\\u201cNuh-uh.\\\\u201d Her brother insisted as he pulled his black bandanna back into place.\\\\nAt once he began searching the ground for fallen apples. The tree branches were far too tall for the zetraloid to reach. Speckle and Smudge watched with skeptical expressions.\\\\n\\\\u201cWhat\\\\u2019re you doing?\\\\u201d Smudge asked with a giggle.\\\\nSpeckle suppressed a laugh at her brother\\\\u2019s idea.\\\\n\\\\u201cYeah but, I can\\\\u2019t reach \\\\u2018um.\\\\u201d The little spotted zetraloid informed.\\\\n\\\\u201cNevermind the apples, Domino, let\\\\u2019s play tag!\\\\u201d Speckle darted from side to side playfully.\\\\nDomino considered it for a moment but seemed indecisive.\\\\n\\\\u201cWhat\\\\u2019s the big deal with the apples anyway?\\\\u201d Smudge asked.\\\\nDomino was silent for a moment before answering.\\\\n\\\\u201cI thought mama might want some.\\\\u201d He pointed his black tipped finger to indicate a small pile of apples which he had collected.\\\\n\\\\u201cBut\\\\u2026\\\\u201d Domino\\\\u2019s gaze trailed to the pile of apples and then the tree. Its size was daunting. No way would he ever be tall enough to reach.\\\\nSpeckle tugged a small green plush snake that had been looped through her brother\\\\u2019s bandanna. She shook it then tip-toed towards the hill slope.\\\\n\\\\u201cHey!\\\\u201d Domino exclaimed in alarm.\\\\n\\\\u201cSnakey thinks you should play with us!\\\\u201d She wiggled the snake between two fingers.\\\\nDomino grabbed for it but missed by inches. He tried to stand tip-toed, intent on getting Snakey back. Speckle frowned and handed it back to her spotted brother. He held it close and rubbed his face against it cheerfully before tucking it back into his bandanna.\\\\n\\\\u201cYou don\\\\u2019t pluck apples, you pick them.\\\\u201d Smudge jumped in to correct him.\\\\nDomino had set about his work of collecting fallen apples again while his sisters giggled and pounced on each other.\\\\nDomino was by their side in a core beat.\\\\nAll three crowded around the small, green, slender body inching along.\\\\n\\\\u201cWhat is it?\\\\u201d Speckle prodded at the creature with her finger.\\\\nShe retracted it with a squeak of surprise as the creature rolled over and thrashed back and forth.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s an inch worm.\\\\u201d Domino informed.\\\\n\\\\u201cIf he\\\\u2019s a worm, why isn\\\\u2019t he in the ground?\\\\u201d Speckle asked.\\\\n\\\\u201cI\\\\u2019ll show him.\\\\u201d Domino volunteered as he pushed his sister aside.\\\\n\\\\u201cBet you aren\\\\u2019t!\\\\u201d Smudge added.\\\\n\\\\u201cYeah!\\\\u201d Speckle pounced on her brother, tumbling him over backwards.\\\\nBefore he could get up again, Smudge joined in, pinning him to the ground. Domino blinked in surprise before laughing and squirming free from their grasp, only to stumble over his own feet and dive head first back to the ground.\\\\nSpeckle and Smudge both giggled as Domino shook his head and spit out dirt. He rubbed a smear off of his face and sneezed. Speckle had already lost interest in the crawling worm and stood at the far slope of the apple tree hill.\\\\n\\\\u201cNot if I do first!\\\\u201d Speckle announced as she dashed ahead.\\\\n\\\\u201cNo fair! You cheated!\\\\u201d Smudge called after her.\\\\nDomino watched from the top of the hill, frowning slightly as he gazed down. Uncertainty fluttered in his stomach like a swarm of butterflies as he turned back to the pile of apples and hid behind them.\\\\nNight had begun to set in as Domino finally left from hiding. Although he couldn\\\\u2019t see in front of himself due to the dark, he ambled on, casting an occasional glance at the outline of a tree or fence.\\\\nOwls hooted from their perches as he walked by. Eyes full of concern and wariness; he quickened his pace until he was in an all out run. The dark. He hated the dark. His foot caught in a fallen branch and he tumbled the remainder of the way.\\\\nCoughing slightly from dust, he stood once more. Now the dim glow of lights from their house told him he was near. A brisk wind whirled dry leaves at his feet. Sometimes he wondered if hiding was worth it.\\\\nBefore long he was at the back door. Its scratchy wood surface told him that. Pushing it open just enough to squeeze through, he headed for the hidden spot beside the dryer. He stifled a cough as the sharp odor of smoke mixed with fabric softener threatened to choke him.\\\\nHe snuggled himself down amongst a basket of dirty clothes and pushed himself against the warm dryer as it clanked and shuddered rhythmatically. All sound from the other room was drowned out. He was relieved by this at least.\\\\nSilhouettes of shelving filled with cans were barely outlined by the light from a different room. Domino yawned as the heat of the dryer warmed him through. He felt safe here. Secure from the world. Pulling Snakey free, he cradled the toy in his arms and drifted to sleep.\\\\nMorning sunlight dazzled through the rear window, waking the small zetraloid. The edges of the window were fogged by the cold. Blinking, Domino scrambled out of the basket and treaded lightly through the house.\\\\nThe tan walls around him were stained with dirt and some places had smears as if the paint from something else had rubbed off. The floor was littered with assorted machinery parts, papers, clothes, and trash. A heavy smell of smoke still clung to the room like thick sap.\\\\nDomino picked his way through carefully until he reached the hallway leading to their front door. He caught sight of his mother, Dotti, a slender Acrobat zetraloid with pink dotted helmet fins surrounded by black and a leather cow-hide print ruffle as well as common jeans.\\\\nShe held the door open with one hand, her black hair flopped over one shoulder as she said goodbye to the zetraloid outside. Domino shivered when he heard his father\\\\u2019s voice from so close. His father, Splotch, was an average Acrobat zetraloid, with armor splotches like a dairy cow\\\\u2019s hide. His blue eyes were always piercingly icy. He wore a red bandanna and brown vest.\\\\nDomino flinched at the harshness of his father. He shouldn\\\\u2019t have hidden. He waited until he heard the door click shut and his mother sigh. Venturing out into the open, he frowned as he tried swallowing the nasty smell away that made his throat ache.\\\\nDotti\\\\u2019s attention was to her son in a heart beat. She kneeled down and embraced him as a lone tear trickled down her cheek.\\\\n\\\\u201cThere\\\\u2019s no need for that.\\\\u201d She answered; her voice soothing and quiet.\\\\nDomino smiled, grateful for her understanding as he pulled Snakey from his bandanna once more and hugged it.\\\\n\\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t want to.\\\\u201d The young zetraloid frowned and crossed his arms.\\\\nDomino scowled while Speckle tip toed around him.\\\\n\\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m not a girl!\\\\u201d He cried.\\\\nDomino blinked before hugging his plushy snake with tight urgency.\\\\nSpeckle climbed across their couch and tore out a handful of stuffing.\\\\n\\\\u201cOops.\\\\u201d She tossed it behind and stretched to reach the radio. Her arm waved wildly back and forth as she tried to balance. Finally her hand grazed it, switching it on as she tumbled to the floor.\\\\n\\\\u201cOof!\\\\u201d Her legs and arms flopped out in every direction.\\\\nSmudge and Domino chuckled and began bouncing in a circle. Speckle hopped up and joined her siblings. They joined hands and spun in a wider circle, Domino having completely forgotten his displeasure of being dressed like a girl.\\\\nSoon enough, the three were bouncing on the couch, laughing. They catapulted double their height into the air before reaching the worn out cushion again. Domino plopped down on the arm rest and rolled onto the ground with a thud. He gazed up at the looming couch and shrugged.\\\\nPicking up Snakey, he began to hum the tune of their song. His head swayed back and forth contently as he used the toy as a microphone, mumbling the few words he knew. Their mother came in from the kitchen, wiping her hands on a dish rag. A quick glimpse of the room was all she needed to make an educated guess on how the radio had been turned on.\\\\nDomino pointed to his sisters with a sudden scowl.\\\\nTurning towards her, he stuck his tongue out.\\\\n\\\\u201cThat\\\\u2019s no way to be a gentleman.\\\\u201d She reprimanded while helping him out of the clothing his sisters had tossed on him.\\\\nDomino hugged his mother as she spoke to his sisters.\\\\n\\\\u201cI know, mama, but its fun.\\\\u201d Speckle squeaked happily.\\\\n\\\\u201cRace ya there!\\\\u201d Speckle called, leading the way.\\\\nDomino and Smudge charged after her and chased each other around the table.\\\\n\\\\u201cDad\\\\u2019s coming home?\\\\u201d Domino took a couple steps back but his mother guided him to join his sisters.\\\\nDomino sighed and climbed up on the box his sisters had used to reach the sink, washing his hands as instructed. He lept off the box and rolled across the floor; he always had enjoyed rolling more than balancing.\\\\n\\\\u201cSpeckle, be nice.\\\\u201d Dotti whisked by to set a warm pot on the table and clear the clutter off it.\\\\n\\\\u201cDo I have to eat?\\\\u201d Domino fidgeted as he kept glancing to their hall.\\\\n\\\\u201cNo.\\\\u201d Her tone was harsher than normal but it didn\\\\u2019t bother him.\\\\n\\\\u201cYes, mama.\\\\u201d He shoved a stack of magazines off his chair.\\\\nMoments later the door slammed against the wall and Splotch walked by the kitchen, not bothering to say hello to anyone. Giggling in delight, Domino\\\\u2019s sisters charged down the hall after him despite their mother\\\\u2019s command not to.\\\\nThey soon returned with their father, still joyful as ever. Bouncing to their chairs, Speckle and Smudge clambered into their places amidst telling their father about the day. Domino climbed into his chair in silence.\\\\nThe fresh scent of warm bread and honey-spread detoured him into a blissful happiness for just a moment.\\\\nHe blinked in surprise, realizing it was his father who had spoken. All had gone silent as Speckle and Smudge were busily chewing their dinner. His mother delicately sliced her food and his father had stopped eating all together.\\\\nDomino gazed up to meet Splotch\\\\u2019s gaze, not daring to speak so soon.\\\\n\\\\u201cYeah.\\\\u201d Domino answered softly as he reached for the bread.\\\\nDomino flinched. His father\\\\u2019s tone had gone from casual to harsh in an instant.\\\\nDomino\\\\u2019s helmet fins drooped down as he spread some of the honey over the warm bread. With any luck his father would decide to talk to someone else or continue eating. The clatter of dinnerware had resumed but he still felt his father\\\\u2019s cold gaze resting on him.\\\\n\\\\u201cYou just better shut y\\\\u2019er mouth!\\\\u201d Splotch pounded the table with his fist, making the plates rattle.\\\\nDomino frowned and gazed down to avoid eye contact.\\\\n\\\\u201cSorry.\\\\u201d Domino apologized, his voice barely audible.\\\\nHe pounded the table again. Domino flinched, still not gazing up.\\\\nNeither of his sisters ever had to address their father as sir. Why he had to made no sense to him. But there would be trouble if he didn\\\\u2019t.\\\\nSplotch tossed his napkin down and shook his head as he turned to leave, beckoning his daughters to follow. His tone was totally different.\\\\nDomino took a bite of the now cold bread and let it scratch down his throat. He didn\\\\u2019t want to go to work with his father, but he had no choice.\\\\nDon\\'t worry XDD it shall be in there XP I promise.\\\\nDomino awoke with a jolt as the frigid air tore him from his blissful rest. Rubbing his eyes, he yawned and stood, surprised to find the room still dark.\\\\nThat was right. He had forgotten all about going to work with his father today. Stretching quickly, he retrieved his plush snake and a jacket, pulling it on as he ran along. Breakfast would most certainly not be ready and that left him to wonder what he would eat. His question was quickly answered by his impatient father.\\\\nSplotch held the door open for Domino. He scurried out and gazed at the early morning, still blanketed in darkness. The chatter of the stream down the hill could be heard. Domino\\'s helmet fins perked up as he followed after Splotch. This early in the morning it was easy to catch all the interesting sounds.\\\\nAs they neared the old wooden bridge Domino slowed down to peer below where a bramble of blackberry bushes grew in unseperatable thickness. A small stream trickled beneath it while moss covered rocks were visible sporadically from the tangle, still damp from the mist. He breathed in deeply, enjoying the fresh, cool, scent of pine.\\\\nScrambling after his father once more, he hopped off the last board of the narrow bridge. Crunchy, dried, pine needles now covered the ground while massive pine trees towered above. Domino shivered as a cold breeze whirled by, carrying with it a few shriveled oak leaves. With one well timed leap, he snatched the leaf out of the sky and carried it on proudly.\\\\n\\\\u201cCome \\'ere.\\\\u201d Splotch pointed directly in front of himself.\\\\nDomino\\'s helmet fins fell to the sides as he ambled over, dragging his pace at a slow rate. The moment seemed to drag on. He braced himself and pulled his head close against his chest and shoulders, fully knowing what was to come.\\\\nA sharp smack to the side of his head. He didn\\\\u2019t dare move; it was rare to be hit only a single time. What did come, however, he hadn\\\\u2019t been far from prepared for. His feet and arms flailed helplessly as he soared through the air and landed ineptly on the hard ground.\\\\nBefore he could get up, he felt his father\\'s foot against his middle and tumbled over again. Gasping for air, he tried gathering all his limbs to work simultaneously, but wasn\\'t quick enough as another kick rolled him against a tree. This time, he stayed down, shutting his eyes as tight as he could while listening to the crunch of pine needles informing him of his father\\'s approach.\\\\nDomino\\'s mind was scrambled. He hardly had any time to think it out before Splotch yanked him to his feet by one arm.\\\\nSplotch\\'s grip tightened as his glare intensified like a blazing fire, but before he had a chance to act on his anger, another zetraloid came along the same bridge.\\\\nSplotch set Domino down in order to shake hands with the other zetraloid. His mood had changed in a moment. Now he and the other were discussing if they thought the weather would hold out. Domino shivered. Suddenly the forest seemed a cold and lonely place. A place cut off from everywhere else\\\\u2014from all safety.\\\\nHe brushed a crumpled leaf out of his bandanna and wiped at the smears of mud on his armor with scarcely a light graze. A tedious throb pulsed through his body and a sharp sting told him he had received some scrapes from rocks on the rough ground.\\\\nNear mechanically, Domino looked to his father. His eyes still seemed just as cold and distant.\\\\nDomino nodded his head and followed after in silence. Small insects scurried out of the way as they trampled along the dirt path hardened by the repetitive routine.\\\\nAt last they reached their destination. A handful of other zetraloids were already gathered around on stumps in a small clearing. Judging by the faint scent lingering in the air, they had doughnuts.\\\\nAt once, Domino recalled the lack of breakfast with the tempting aroma of maple and chocolate-- yes, chocolate especially.\\\\nSplotch joined the others, sitting on an old log along with a few others. Unsure of what else to do, Domino pulled himself onto the log beside his father. The group rambled on with what Domino assumed must be jokes as they laughed and occasionally snatched up another doughnut.\\\\nHe watched the remainder on the plate, imagining how the moist treat would flake apart. Its chocolaty frosting, coat his mouth and bring with it the rich flavor to gush out. His tongue swirled against the walls of his mouth. Such delicious food, just beyond reach.\\\\nAt last his father and the others rose to set about their job. They \\'fell\\' trees\\\\u2014that\\'s what they said anyway. Loggers of such.\\\\nDomino blinked and turned to face his father. The zetraloid was pulling his gloves on.\\\\nDomino sighed and watched as his father fell in pace behind the others. All trod down another well worn pathway that lead deeper into the forest\\\\u2014beyond what he could see.\\\\nSoon the whir of machinery roared to life. Smog billowed high above the tallest trees. The ground vibrated from the heavy equipment and every so often he would hear someone shout to another. After what seemed forever, a deafening snap would echo back--the kind of thick, wet, snap that made one know a broken bone was in bad shape. He assumed the same could be said for the state of the tree.\\\\nDomino leaned back on the log and gazed at the sky above. By now, the sun had come out although it was hidden behind a thick blanket of clouds.\\\\n\\\\u201cHmm...\\\\u201d Reaching into a fold of his bandanna closest to his neck, he pulled out the green toy snake. \\\\u201cWhat\\'da ya think, Snakey? Wanna see the clouds?\\\\u201d He held his toy up towards the sky, clasped with care between his black tipped fingers.\\\\nAfter a few moments, he scooted off the log and knelt beside it, pulling his toy across in a slithering motion. He set a pile of pine needles, brown and crisp, in front of the snake.\\\\nSnatching up the snake again, he spun in a circle, making swooping noises for his toy snake that could now, apparently fly.\\\\n\\\\u201cThere\\'s no room to land!\\\\u201d He called out then covered his mouth to muffle sound, \\\\u201cSnakey to airplane place, I\\'ll be fine, over, kch. Coming in for landing. Kch Kch.\\\\u201d He let go of the snake, sending it swirling through the sky. It landed upside down on a rock.\\\\nDomino didn\\'t hesitate to pounce on it. He pushed the snake off and eyed up the rock before planting his hands spread firm on it and then kicked out, pulling his legs up until he was in proper handstand position.\\\\nLetting his feet fall down once more, he hopped up and brushed his hands against each other.\\\\nHe grabbed Snakey from the ground and laughed as he tossed the toy into the sky once more, but this time it flew over the small ledge where he had been playing.\\\\nDomino hurried to the edge of the clearing, sloping down was thick brush. It\\'s slender but bountiful branches stuck out every direction, and far within it lay his snake. He walked around the giant clump but found no easier entrance.\\\\nHe flung the stick at the fortress holding his snake hostage only to have it rattle against the mass and pelt him with sharp twigs. He blinked and shook them off before stepping forward to challenge the enemy.\\\\nOf course the \\'twig\\' had no change of heart, forcing him to confront it even further. He pulled one of the branches back and reached for the toy but it was still beyond his grasp. Giving up on reaching Snakey, he attempted to disassemble the mass. He grabbed the rough branch with both hands and tugged, promptly falling back as the branch dislodged.\\\\n\\\\u201cTake that, branch!\\\\u201d He jumped up and down on the thin little branch before going after the next.\\\\nAfter about three more, he grew tired of freeing his snake and skittered around the patch. Hopping the remainder of the way atop crunchy leaves, he found himself at another divide of the creek by the bridge.\\\\nIt chattered industriously as the water tumbled over and around smooth stones. Small fish wiggled below the surface of the clear water as well as a few small plants. Domino stretched his arm out and plunged it beneath the water after a fish. Instead of a fish though, he caught a pile of pebbles. Releasing his catch, he pounced into the cold water and splashed about in its shallow depths. It was hardly to his waist if he stood and only three hop lengths to the small island in the center. It was even shorter from the other side where a small, mossy, log formed a bridge.\\\\nThe sun had drifted behind the towering pines by now and the water was basked in rippling shadows. With darkness creeping in, the water\\'s temperature had dropped drastically. Domino crept out and sat huddled up on the bank as droplets of water ran to the tip of his nose and dripped off.\\\\nRemembering his snake, he hurried back to its location and tried squeezing beneath a few of the branches. To his alarm, he got stuck halfway. Squirming, he tried to free himself but did nothing more than scratch his armor\\\\u2014his father would be furious.\\\\nIn the distance, Snakey lay beneath a tangle of branches. He stretched his arm out once more, finally reaching his snake.\\\\n\\\\u201cSnakey!\\\\u201d He tucked the toy in his bandanna and attempted crawling through the way Snakey had gone but to no success.\\\\nAfter a few more attempts, he sighed and pulled out the snake again. His mouth stretched wide in a yawn as he clumped the snake up like a pillow and rested his head on it. He meant only to wait, but tiredness took over and he was soon fast asleep.\\\\nAw...I looked through my dance book and they don\\'t have the Flipside dance. D= Maybe if I call and complain I can get a refund and a few coupons. ANYWAY on to chapter...four? You mean the greatness I\\'ve been reading all along has been condensed into but three chapters?! How is this possible? =O That much awesome could never fit into such a small space. Ah..rant. Why does\\'t thou keepeth me from reading the devine beauty above? xDD Okay on to reading.\\\\nAw geez..the dreaded walk of shame. ._. Yep, a smack. How nice. STOP BEATING DOMINO YOU JERK!!! D= Geez. He doesn\\'t deserve to be kicked and stuff..especially from his own father. ._. Yeah now be all nice. >_> This is a sad story. =( Lying mean father...I guess he does go to work to support his family so he must care somewhat...and he\\'s probably mad at Domino because he was worried about him but still..it\\'s not fair and this saddened feeling will not go away. Maybe if I take the Splotch approach I can beat it and it\\'ll leave.\\\\nHA HA HA!! They do have donuts!!! Rockin\\'. xD Wow I never use that term. Poor guy. Hungry, no donut. =\\\\\\\\ Innocent playing with Snakey. Wow that is SO easy to imagine. @_@ Snakey can fllly. =D xDD Amazin\\' Domino! xDD He is so innocent now something bad is bound to happen. xD Small attention span eh? xDD MUST SAVE SNAKEY. No...no...NOT SLEEP. No...he\\'s going to be in serious trouble. >_< Oh geez.\\\\nVery well written, I think this is mah favorite story of the ones you\\'ve written so far. xD I\\'m not exactly sure why, but it is very entertaining. =P Thanks ya much for posting.\\\\nA smack how nice XDD then Brad gets more frantic. And no he does not ._.\\\\nSomething bad bound to happen XDD yes he did get easily side tracked.\\\\nFYI this chapter I\\\\u2019m trying another ol technique I\\\\u2019ve been learning. The importance of short sentences to move action. To make interesting. Short. To the point. Action. Like in action ya know? Nevermind lol, you\\\\u2019ll see.\\\\nDomino followed his father in solemn silence, with head down and helmet fins drooping. The entire walk home had consisted of Splotch yelling about how he hadn\\\\u2019t stayed where told to and made them waste precious daylight in searching for him. Now they were heading to the rabbits. He cast a wishful glance at their house in the distance as they reached the barn, but knew they wouldn\\\\u2019t be going there until finished. He probably didn\\\\u2019t deserve dinner anyway. Today hadn\\\\u2019t been his best display of obedience.\\\\nHe stumbled as his father shoved a bucket into his arms. After tottering back and forth for a few moments, he steadied out and followed. Rabbit feed. It undeniably smelled strange, like an assortment of grass and crushed leaves. The pellets were dusty, yet they looked somewhat edible. He blinked as he gazed up at the hutches containing the furry creatures. They wouldn\\\\u2019t miss a few of these strange pellets. He shoved a handful into his mouth and tried crunching them up.\\\\nHe turned to his father.\\\\nSplotch snatched the bucket of feed from him and took it upon himself to feed the rabbits.\\\\nDomino grimaced as the scratchy pellets caught in his throat. How could the rabbits eat such things? Did they constantly choke as well? He took another strained gulp, only to feel the trapped food stop up his throat like a plug. He tried calling for help but no sound was made and instead resorted to hopping from foot to foot and pushing on his neck.\\\\nAfter feeding the last rabbit on the row, Splotch turned and noticed him. Abandoning the bucket, he rushed to his son, flipped him upside down and shook him. Domino coughed the pellets up and gasped as his father set him down. Maybe rabbit feed wasn\\\\u2019t such a good choice for a replacement meal.\\\\nSplotch scrutinized him, but was just as soon distracted by a voice outside of the rabbit barn. He headed for the door but stopped short, gaze drifting to Domino. The little zetraloid fidgeted.\\\\n\\\\u201cLike you did earlier today?\\\\u201d He reached for his son and plucked him from his place before looking for a suitable location to leave him. The barn was bare of anything of real use for such a purpose. A lone rake leaned against the back wall while a hoard of cobwebs entangled the ceiling. Aside from a few other tools, the only things there were the rabbit hutches. The rabbit hutches, of course. He cast a glance at the little zetraloid and unlatched one of the doors.\\\\nHis father had already gone.\\\\nDomino hunched himself over so he wouldn\\\\u2019t get caught in the wiring. He\\\\u2019d hate to be the rabbits that had to stay in these tiny box-like homes all their lives. Wrapping his arms around his knees, he gazed at the rabbit munching the pellets it had been given. Its red and pink eyes were eerie in contrast to its white fur. Maybe it was a monster rabbit. He shook his head. That was a ridiculous idea\\\\u2026wasn\\\\u2019t it?\\\\nHe tried focusing on his father\\\\u2019s voice beyond the doors. He could hear both of them\\\\u2014his father and his visitor that was. His helmet fins drooped once more. If he hadn\\\\u2019t run off earlier maybe his father wouldn\\\\u2019t be angry\\\\u2014or if he hadn\\\\u2019t hid the other night by the apple tree. Would his father ever forgive him now? Why couldn\\\\u2019t they get along like his sisters did?\\\\nHe couldn\\\\u2019t remember doing anything to start this. He\\\\u2019d always wanted to have the same relationship, but his father only ever accused him of his downfalls. He was useless\\\\u2014that\\\\u2019s what his father said\\\\u2014and spent too much time worrying about having fun when he could be working or making himself useful. Was it so wrong to have fun though? He couldn\\\\u2019t understand why it would be.\\\\nThe light streaks that once slit through the wall boards had dimmed black. His father\\\\u2019s definition of being right back had dragged on to far more than that. Straining his transmitters, he tried to pick up his father\\\\u2019s voice again, but heard only the chirp of crickets. Had he been forgotten?\\\\nDomino smacked his head on the top as he tried getting to the latch, causing the monster rabbit to rattle the hutch as it hopped from its spot. He flopped down, catching the beast with his foot. It squealed in terror and darted all the more frantic.\\\\nHis efforts were in vain as the creature ran over the top of him in its circular pattern. He scrambled to the door and shoved himself against it.\\\\nNo response. He tried reaching the latch through the wiring but found the space too small to fit his hand through. The rabbit hopped towards him. He pushed himself against the door even harder, until his shoulders were bunched up by his neck.\\\\nWith a sudden lurch, the door burst open. He tumbled out, landing square on his back. The rabbit was peering over its hutch opening, nose twitching, as Domino propped himself up and blinked. That had been unexpected. He sneezed and glanced up.\\\\nThe rabbit\\\\u2019s furry body dared edge closer and closer. He leaped to his feet and reached for the door, but the rabbit scurried in a blizzard of white fur and plopped to the ground. It fled with ease to a hole in the wood and squeezed its body through.\\\\n\\\\u201cNo, wait!\\\\u201d Domino called after it.\\\\nHe dashed to the door and bounced up to hit its latch before hanging on as it drifted open with a creak. His feet kicked with spry urgency before he let go and landed just outside. The sky dazzled with stars and a full moon bathed the ground in blue light. His father had forgotten about him!\\\\nThe rabbit hopped by in front of him and nibbled at a stalk of grass. Attention refocused, he crept forward with slow and steady steps as not to alarm the creature. Its ears perked up as its head swiveled towards him. He stopped. Its eyes looked straight to him, causing him to sigh. He knew what was to follow. The white creature fled.\\\\nHe had to catch the rabbit. His father would be even angrier at him if he found out. It might diminish his hopes of making amends all together. Ice churned in his belly as he slid to a stop and panted. Before him, low shrubs and bushes lay in the shadows of pines. The rabbit was gone.\\\\nHe crept towards the bushes and did his best to search around them. No rabbit. His helmet fins drooped at the reconfirming fact. It was gone. But he couldn\\\\u2019t go back empty handed, could he? Maybe he could find a wild rabbit. No, that wouldn\\\\u2019t work; they looked nothing like the white rabbits his father raised.\\\\nHe fumbled over to a rock and sat down. It had to be somewhere around here. Rabbits didn\\\\u2019t vanish after all\\\\u2014not unless they were the ones on magic shows. So that meant it had to be around. Maybe he could wait for it\\\\u2014it was evident no one at the house was missing him.\\\\nThe night was silent. No owls, the chirp of crickets had died away leaving only the whispers of gentle breeze. He rubbed his hand over the domino attached to his arm and peered out at the darkened shadows lapping at the ground. Surely the rabbit would turn up soon. Wasn\\\\u2019t it cold? He was.\\\\nWhat started as minutes stretched on. Domino yawned and huddled himself up tighter on the small rock. It was as cold and lonely as the relationship he had with his father. Maybe that could be his motivation\\\\u2014the motivation for changing it. That was what would compel him to keep trying. To catch that rabbit\\\\u2026to stay awake. He blinked his eyes and sat up straighter, only to slump back down. Before long his eyes closed and breathing slowed to a dull, rhythmatic beat.\\\\nA high-pitched squeal broke the sleep of night. Domino tumbled backwards off the rock as a series of longer, pained squeals erupted. Scrambling back, he fled up the hillside into the open space, eyes wide as his head lashed from side to side, checking that nothing had followed. The squeals died away with a final, weary cry. Breeze tugged at his bandanna as he shivered.\\\\nThe rabbit. Those squeals. No doubt the white furred creature had become another\\\\u2019s dinner. He felt his face heat up, despite the icy chill, as a few tears streaked his face. He had ruined it. Any chance he had of capturing it. Any chance of fixing his mistake. Any chance of pleasing his father. Everything. Eyes now streaming with tears, he charged off towards their house, stumbling over his own feet.\\\\nOh yeah. >_> I started this chapter happy ya know? Well now you do. So anyway I just remembered how mean his father was in that one chapter and I am mad at him now. Eh por Domino. >_> He thinks it\\'s his fault. xD You know, so many odd coincidental things happen that parents don\\'t seem to believe the youngin\\'s until they are much older. >_> Poor Domino.\\\\nHeeeeey. =. Splotch does seem to care. He rushed over to save his poor curious son. Hmmm he may not be so bad after all. I\\'m guessing you can\\'t do the heimlich (sp?) on a zetra? xDD Instead you gotta flip em\\' and shake em\\'. I bet humans don\\'t save many of them from choking. ._.\\\\nHumans don\\'t save many zetras. xD Sorry I wasn\\'t clear. Because it seems like zetras are kind heavy and stuff and, believe it or not, as a human I can see how we would be not to helpful in such a situation. xD Well you are doing a fantastic job whatever you\\'re doing...the story is great.\\\\nAfter a bazillion years I managed to get over my emo self enough ti post something. I don\\'t garuntee its as good cuz well I\\'m out of practice for way too long.\\\\nDomino had crawled into his bed by early morning, sobbing on his pillow until he\\\\u2019d fallen asleep. Now he\\\\u2019d awoke, still sleepy from the night before and glanced around before recalling the rabbit. Had it all been a dream? He shook his head. No, it hadn\\\\u2019t. Today was Sunday\\\\u2014his father didn\\\\u2019t work Sundays, which meant he got up later.\\\\nHe was bound to discover the missing rabbit soon. Maybe he\\\\u2019d just be glad he had escaped? No. He shook his head again. How would he explain? What would happen? He felt tears forming in his eyes once more as dread tore at his core.\\\\nHis door opened as his two sisters burst into the room. They stopped abruptly.\\\\n\\\\u201cDid\\\\u2019ja get hurt?\\\\u201d Speckle was already by his side, gazing at him up close.\\\\nBefore he could answer, he heard the front door slammed against the wall.\\\\n\\\\u201cDomino!!\\\\u201d His father\\\\u2019s words rang through the house and Domino cringed, not meeting his sisters\\\\u2019 confused gazes as he pulled his blanket and pillow over his head.\\\\nHis father stomped down the hall, stopping only to push the door open all the way. He knocked over a stack of books in the process and moved briskly to Domino\\\\u2019s bed. His sisters fled as their father tore back the blanket and jerked Domino out by an arm. Domino didn\\\\u2019t dare make a noise though as his father marched silently out of the room, dragging him along.\\\\nHe could barely keep up with the brisk pace as his father held his arm captive. Tripping over a towel that had been left on the floor, he twisted his arm painfully. His father took no regard and proceeded to pass his mother whom had emerged from her room with a worried frown.\\\\nDomino\\\\u2019s core raced as they neared the barn. He knew exactly what they would find\\\\u2014or wouldn\\\\u2019t, more like it. His father hadn\\\\u2019t mentioned anything about having left him here last night and he had a feeling it was intentional.\\\\nHe glanced up to see the empty hutch, and then to his father. The zetraloid\\\\u2019s glare told him all he needed to know.\\\\nDomino fell silent as he watched his own feet, unwilling to look into his father\\\\u2019s icy eyes. It wasn\\\\u2019t like he would listen anyway. The best he could hope for was minimum trouble now. He had no real way to defend himself against any claim his father made. Even if he did, what good would it really do?\\\\n\\\\u201cYou know better than this!\\\\u201d His father repeated and slammed his hand down on the little empty hutch.\\\\nWhat was he to answer? If he admitted the creature had frightened him, his father would be even more furious. If he chose to say because he had simply wanted to, it would save him from additional anger, but also be a lie. Was there any other option though? It wasn\\\\u2019t like his father didn\\\\u2019t know the real reason to begin with.\\\\nHe twiddled his thumbs together, mind reeling for an answer when his father lashed out with one hand. Domino shook his head and frowned as he reached to rub his face. It stung, but that was to be expected. What he hadn\\\\u2019t expected was the boiling frustration he felt flushing his face. Still, he managed to hold back a retort and flattened his helmet fins instead.\\\\nDomino blinked and rubbed his jaw as he gazed up at his father. Didn\\\\u2019t he love him at all? Was he really only a liability? His father was in a blind fury it seemed as he grabbed the handle of a broken shovel and swung it at him. He took a few steps back to avoid being hit.\\\\nHis father didn\\\\u2019t let him finish as he grabbed the little zetraloid by one helmet fin and yanked him up.\\\\n\\\\u201cOw!\\\\u201d Domino squeaked as he tried pushing his father\\\\u2019s hand away to no avail.\\\\nWith disregard to Domino\\\\u2019s complaint, Splotch smacked him with the handle multiple times before it splintered and broke. With a grumble, he tossed it aside and searched for a new tool to use, at last settling for a small, garden spade.\\\\n\\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m sorry!\\\\u201d Domino exclaimed, but Splotch took no note of it as he lifted the little zetraloid off the ground once more and began striking him with his new tool.\\\\nDomino reached out helplessly, in no position to succeed in getting free. He didn\\\\u2019t dare cry out though. To do so would provoke a response from his father far more fearsome than this.\\\\nDomino cringed, but didn\\\\u2019t answer his father\\\\u2019s question. His mind was far too sidetracked to attempt such a feat. His helmet fins braced against his head as he tried blocking out the pain. It wasn\\\\u2019t that bad after awhile. He knew if his father continued on long enough it\\\\u2019d become dull\\\\u2014an almost distant feeling. He didn\\\\u2019t mind the numbness so much.\\\\nAt last his father stopped. Domino\\\\u2019s helmet fins slowly rose as he cast an uncertain glance to his father. The zetraloid hardly looked back at him as he set him down. Domino didn\\\\u2019t move, rather gazing to the side as he waited for some kind of signal that he was allowed to go.\\\\nSplotch sighed as he set the spade down; one corner of it had a bright blue substance staining the hardened soil stuck on it. Domino frowned, and ran his hand over his own shoulder. Much as he had expected, he felt the cooling trail of plasma trickling from a small gash. His attention returned to his father though.\\\\nSplotch paid no attention to him. Rather stepping around him and leaving without a single word. It never ended that way for kids on t.v. When they apologized, their parents loved them again. Why didn\\\\u2019t that work for his own father?\\\\nDomino watched as his father headed down the path leading to their neighbors. Why? He wasn\\\\u2019t entirely sure. Probably to argue over something. Guilt jerked at his throat as he left the rabbit barn and headed back down the path to their house. He hoped his father wouldn\\\\u2019t be angry still when he returned\\\\u2014it was just a stupid rabbit.\\\\nAs he neared their house, he spotted his sisters heading down towards the creek with baskets. They both stopped upon seeing him and waited for him to catch up.\\\\nDespite all that had happened, Domino couldn\\\\u2019t help but grin as Speckle hugged him.\\\\nHe followed after his two sisters as they dashed along the path. They tromped down the side of the hill, and across prickly sticks and twigs until they came to a stop beside the little creek that trickled through their property.\\\\nThe sun had risen by now and glistened off the water crisscrossed by the shade of skeleton-like branches. The gentle churn of the little waterfall downstream was masked by the buzz of dragonflies and the croak of frogs. Blackberry bushes trailed from the rocky ground, tendrils dipping into the water at places.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt smells so good down here!\\\\u201d Speckle announced, taking in a deep whiff.\\\\n\\\\u201cYou think anything with food is heaven!\\\\u201d Smudge giggled.\\\\nDomino shrugged and stepped in the shallow water, glancing around. Birds chirped above and ruffled their feathers out while a frog launched itself into the water with a plunk. He made his way to the other side, taking care not to slip on the slimy rocks hidden beneath the water\\\\u2019s surface. Blackberry bush branches stretched out in front in tangled masses.\\\\nUp until now, he had forgotten all about being hungry. He reached for one of the plump blackberries and plucked it free before plopping it onto his tongue and munching contently. Swiping his tongue around his mouth, he reached for another and gobbled it up. He spied another flourishing branch above and stretched, snagging five more berries and munching once more.\\\\nHis sisters were busy on the other side, giggling and tossing their berries into the baskets. Domino smiled. It was peaceful without his father around and he could have fun with his sisters without a care in the world.\\\\nAfter collecting more of the scrumptious berries, he sat on a rock surrounded by the shallow waters and watched leaves swirl down its pathway.\\\\n\\\\u201cWhat?\\\\u201d Domino asked, licking at the purple stains on his hands.\\\\nDomino grinned, holding out a berry and licking it slowly before plopping it into his mouth. Speckle smirked and launched herself into the water, splashing Domino.\\\\nHe splashed her back and before long, the two were rolling in its shallow depths. Smudge watched from a distance, not at all wanting to get wet and muddy like her crazy siblings.\\\\nShe put her hands on her hips, \\\\u201cYou\\\\u2019ve done gone and lost your minds!\\\\u201d The comment went unnoticed.\\\\nDomino slipped from his sister\\\\u2019s grasp and pulled her over. The two tumbled head over heels off of a small drop in the creek. The pool of water below was much deeper. Speckle gasped in surprise as she used Domino\\\\u2019s head as a platform to escape with. Domino laughed before his head was shoved underwater. He resurfaced quickly, shaking his head as he followed. He hopped atop a rock and shook his head again, sprinkling water droplets on the vibrant leaves around him. If only it could be like this all the time.\\\\n\\\\u201cHey, come and help us!\\\\u201d Speckle called to him again, she had returned to picking berries.\\\\nHe nodded and scurried over to her before helping. They were tasty little things. Blackberry pie. Blackberry jam. Blackberries and ice cream\\\\u2014they had tons of uses. All of which, he approved of.\\\\nOnce the baskets were full, they skipped back up the trail, pausing a time or two to point out a colorful flower or fluttering butterfly. Although he didn\\\\u2019t see the appeal of the specified creatures, he followed along with enthusiastic responses.\\\\nWhen they reached the top, they paused before taking a different path home\\\\u2014across the old log by the broken down fence. The one with weeds that reached to his nose. Why they chose this path was agreed upon by all. It was simply more fun.\\\\n\\\\u201cBet\\\\u2019cha can\\\\u2019t hop this far!\\\\u201d Speckle called out.\\\\nSmudge tried, but fell short. Speckle giggled and pointed at her while she tried to recover with grace. Domino was next, running to the end of the log and leaping. His feet met the earth and with satisfaction, he noted that he had made it further.\\\\n\\\\u201cLucky!\\\\u201d Speckle tossed an acorn at him.\\\\n\\\\u201cOh yeah?\\\\u201d She set her basket down and lept at him.\\\\nHe dashed to the side. She tripped over a rock and caught his leg, pulling him with her.\\\\nDomino\\\\u2019s nose wrinkled as one of the weeds\\\\u2019 fluffy, seeded, tips tickled his nose. Speckle hopped up and laughed.\\\\nDomino shook his head, sprinkling dandelion fluff every direction as he got up. He was just about to pounce on his sister when their mother\\\\u2019s voice echoed from far downhill. Speckle rolled her eyes and sighed.\\\\nDomino nodded, brushing the dried grass from his bandanna as he followed along. A cold breeze swooped down on him as he rushed down the hillside\\\\u2014more frigid than the typical autumn air. Winter would be on its way soon. He loved winter, but neither he nor anyone else knew just what this winter had in store for them.\\\\nFirst of all, I cannot wait to get reading. Flipside is thus far my favorite story of yours AND I haven\\'t had any new Ten story reading material in so long. So I am quite excited.

Domino yawned and stretched his stubby fingers before curling them around Snakey\\\\u2019s plush body. Eyes glazed in sleep, his head bobbed forward. A deafening growl came from the machine down the hill. He leapt from his spot, before hurrying to regain his composure as his father walked by. His father had chosen to bring him all the way this time\\\\u2014to prevent him from getting in trouble. He\\\\u2019d already been warned about the consequences he would face if he disobeyed.\\\\nHis father was in an especially cheerless mood today, granted he wasn\\\\u2019t cheerful any day. It was a shame not to be cheery with Christmas so near.\\\\nEverything was right. A dazzling sheet of powdery snow, frozen creeks, pines peaking beneath the white dust. It definitely shown of Christmas. They would decorate their own Christmas tree soon. He was confident. It had sat outside for two days already in order for the bugs to crawl out and find new homes and a winter storm was scheduled to blow in soon so their father would want it situated before then.\\\\nA frigid breeze spattered him with snow. He shook his head and shook out his bandanna as well. It was cold today; maybe he should\\\\u2019ve brought a jacket. Glancing down the slope, he noticed his father and the others struggling to secure their footing by a tall pine. The snow had turned to a sloshing mud.\\\\nIt wasn\\\\u2019t ideal logging weather at all, but it wasn\\\\u2019t against safety regulations for a zetraloid to try anyway\\\\u2014at least he didn\\\\u2019t think it was. An echoing holler pierced all the noise as the zetraloids tried to roll the log to its side. It was almost pointless. They couldn\\\\u2019t send them down any waterway here. The creek was too small\\\\u2014and frozen.\\\\nFrozen. Ice skating. Ice skating was fun, or so it looked on T.V. He betted he could do it, but no, he\\\\u2019d be in trouble if he left his spot. He tossed Snakey into the air and caught his green companion before pressing it into the snow to make an imprint.\\\\nDomino had big plans for today. He would build snowmen. They could battle against the snow blobs. Then he\\\\u2019d have a snowball fight. Speckle would never see it coming!\\\\nDomino blinked and shook himself back to reality. His father was calling him from down the hill. He hopped through the mounds of snow until he was close enough to see and hear his father distinctly.\\\\nSplotch was covered in mud from helmet fins to feet, which must have been buried in the muck, and was grumbling at the tree as well by the looks of it.\\\\n\\\\u201cWhat chain?\\\\u201d Domino struggled to make his voice loud enough to be heard.\\\\n\\\\u201cOh.\\\\u201d It was more to himself than anything.\\\\nJust as his father had said, there was a chain wrapped around the stump they had set their other supplies on. Around and around he hopped until the chain was free. He walked back to the slope and eyed up a bare strip of mud. A grin spread across his face as he charged forward and let himself slip down it. Of course this made the chain mud laden as well. He smiled as he offered it to his father.\\\\nSplotch held out his hand without bothering to look at its condition. It was unlikely to matter anyway, everything was covered in mud. Domino made faces at the mud sticking to his feet as he stomped down on it.\\\\n\\\\u201cStay out of the way!\\\\u201d Splotch growled as he shoved Domino back before the log crushed him.\\\\n\\\\u201cSorry.\\\\u201d He muttered, but couldn\\\\u2019t even hear his own words over the buzz of chainsaws and clank, clank, clank of their lever machine. He shook a plop of mud that had found its way onto his armor off and headed to the creek side.\\\\nHis father said nothing on the matter although he was sure he could see. That made it okay, right? He was out of the way after all, and if they needed his help then he would hear them better from here.\\\\nHe sat on a rock by the frozen water\\\\u2019s edge. It had been covered in a thin layer of fluffy snow. Beneath the ice, bubbles of oxygen collected. He tapped on the ice. Nothing happened. A loud shout drew his attention away. His father was flailing his arms in gestures unseen by Domino before. The focal point of his odd behavior was none other than a zetraloid he\\\\u2019d heard called Crag. It seemed as though the gestures offended him as he pointed and argued back. Boring.\\\\nDomino returned to inspecting the creek. Was it hard enough to walk on? He tapped it with his foot. It felt solid and it didn\\\\u2019t show any sign of being insufficient. Holding the rock with his fingertips, he stretched himself out to test it with both feet. Near instantly he slipped and hit his knees on it with all his weight, but nothing happened.\\\\nHe felt it with an outstretched hand. It was almost like a rock. A very cold rock. Making his way back to solid ground, he cast another glance at his father before taking a running leap at the iced creek. Everything turned to a whitish whir as he swung in circles, further and further out onto the ice, stopping in the center. Laughing, he tried to stand, only to have his legs sprawl out once more. Snaky slipped from its place and plopped onto the ice.\\\\n\\\\u201cYou don\\\\u2019t skate very gooder.\\\\u201d Domino informed it as he tied the toy to his bandanna.\\\\nHe began pulling himself off the ice so that he could take another run at it. It wasn\\\\u2019t easy, but eventually he wormed his way back to the snow laden ground.\\\\nThat was Snakebite. Domino\\\\u2019s sisters often spoke of rumors about how the zetraloid had gotten his name. They liked to claim he tore a snake in two with his teeth, but Domino suspected it had something to do with his two curved fangs. In fact, he was almost frightening if one didn\\\\u2019t know him.\\\\nOne eye was yellow while the other was red and he had armor that resembled overlapping scales. Not to mention it was striped in shades of brown, tan and black much like a rattlesnake and even had a long, snake-like tail. Despite appearance, Snakebite was one of the nicest zetraloids Domino knew. Granted that number was small, but nevertheless he ranked high on the list.\\\\n\\\\u201cLot\\\\u2019s a fun!\\\\u201d Domino chimed in reply as he leapt up on a rock.\\\\nSnakebite\\\\u2019s attention shifted at the vreer of another chainsaw. The zetraloid, Crag had ventured further along the creek and was tackling a different tree alone.\\\\nHe returned to Splotch and the others.\\\\nDomino shrugged before glancing at Crag. Why was he working alone? Maybe it had something to do with his father\\\\u2019s previous conversation. He scurried along the snow covered slope, tumbling back down a time or two before successfully clinging to a rock and clambering up.\\\\nCrag took no notice of him so he came closer to wait for an opening. The chainsaw kicked back with a high pitched vreer before Crag shut it off and kicked the tree. It did little good of course and instead only caused him to grumble some kind of inaudible line of words and rub his foot.\\\\n\\\\u201cI just wanted to say hi!\\\\u201d Domino followed him to the other side. It seemed Crag needed some cheering up.\\\\n\\\\u201cHow come y\\\\u2019er up here?\\\\u201d Domino followed once more as he circled around the large tree, inspecting it.\\\\nStill no answer. Crag returned to the place his chainsaw had sliced into and ran his hand over it.\\\\nHe flashed a quick glance at Domino, eyes slanted in anger and a persistent frown tugging at the corners of his mouth.\\\\n\\\\u201c\\\\u2019Y\\\\u2019er wastin\\\\u2019 time \\\\u2018n daylight!\\\\u201d A familiar voice echoed from below, loud and clear.\\\\nCrag\\\\u2019s eyes were aflame like hot coal as he reached for his chainsaw, clenching his mouth shut and turning back towards the tree.\\\\n\\\\u201cDad knows lots about making trees fall over in the snow!\\\\u201d Domino offered cheerfully.\\\\nDomino noticed Crag\\\\u2019s hand now had a death grip on the chainsaw\\\\u2019s handle, almost to the point of shaking. At last he turned away from Splotch with a snort of disgust as he tugged the starter for the chainsaw a few times, however, in the cold, the device wasn\\\\u2019t working as well.\\\\nCrag smacked his hand away from the chain\\\\u2019s teeth. Domino blinked in surprise and scrambled back. He clasped his hands together and took a few more steps back as Crag approached. Helmet fins down, he began edging towards the direction farthest from Crag. That happened to lead to a dead end of the ledge which overlooked the creek below.\\\\nCrag\\\\u2019s helmet fins perked up as he watched. A smirk coiled at the edge of his mouth, eyes glimmering with satisfaction.\\\\n\\\\u201cDomino, Domino, my little buddy.\\\\u201d He took a few steps towards him.\\\\nConfused, Domino stepped back half a step and felt his foot begin to slip. Crag\\\\u2019s arm shot out though, catching him by his wrist before he could fall.\\\\nDomino gazed up at him. His smirk had faded into a welcoming smile, so he decided to smile back.\\\\nDomino followed where Crag pointed. The frozen creek. Close to where he was working. It was at least thirty feet across or so.\\\\n\\\\u201cNonsense! I\\\\u2019ll be able to keep an eye on you for him, don\\\\u2019t worry! Just go have some fun.\\\\u201d he pushed Domino along towards the downward slope leading to the frozen bank of the creek.\\\\n\\\\u201cUh\\\\u2026well okay.\\\\u201d Domino agreed as he was ushered to its side. Before he\\\\u2019d gotten a chance to even test the edge, Crag had shoved him onto it.\\\\n\\\\u201cAh!\\\\u201d Domino yelped in surprise as he slammed down face first on the ice. He shook his head and looked up to see Crag smile and wave, before leaving and returning to the tree.\\\\nDomino grimaced as he tried pulling his legs beneath himself for balance. They barely stayed put long enough for him to spin in a circle. He crossed his arms and glared before scrambling once more. It pushed him a foot or so, but he still couldn\\\\u2019t get up.\\\\nThe chainsaw had roared to life again. That was good. Succeeding was bound to cheer Crag up\\\\u2014whatever his issue was. Domino returned to his ice skating. Or sliding. Since he couldn\\\\u2019t stand, he settled for pushing himself around on his belly. Even that required serious leg work though and he scarcely covered any distance.\\\\nBy now he\\\\u2019d propelled himself out into the center again. He paused, looking at the ice, then shivered. Black water was lapping hungrily just below. Down here the creek was deeper than where it streamed down the mountainside. It was a sort of pocket, a twelve foot deep pocket. It made him wonder. In cold weather like this\\\\u2026could anything survive in it?\\\\nA loud creak peeled his attention from the ice. A tree. Its groaning, wood splitting, roar tore through the forest around it. Crag\\\\u2019s tree of course\\\\u2014seemed he had finally cut it free. It was headed over the ledge he\\\\u2019d nearly fallen off of. Hmm, that was strange. Why did he want it to fall that way? Crag would never be able to pull it off of the ice. He couldn\\\\u2019t even stand!\\\\nThe massive tree came crashing down, limbs lashing wildly as the beast of a tree reached the ice. At the same moment, he noticed the tree hadn\\\\u2019t stayed on top of it\\\\u2014it had crashed through! He glanced down as the shifting creaks of ice sounded all around him. Hairline fractures unfolded before him like spider web.\\\\nHis helmet fins pulled back in a flash as he looked to the ledge for Crag. Nothing. The ice beneath him had begun to sink, letting the water seep above the surface. The front lurched forward and shattered. He tried leaning back only for that to split as well.\\\\nHelplessly, he plunged into the frigid water. He cried out for help as its razor cold current whipped him around. Near instantly his body was tense and he desperately reached out with one hand towards the remaining ice. It crumbled in his hand.\\\\nHis cry tapered off as the water forced him down into its depths. Struggling, he bobbed above the surface again. Eyes shut tight; he flailed an arm with slow jerking motions.\\\\n\\\\u201cHe\\\\u2014ngh!\\\\u201d He cringed as he smashed against the tree.\\\\nHis frozen hand caught in one of the branches and he desperately tried to wrap his fingers around it. Eyes now open, his head swished to one side. He could only hear the crashing of creek water as it slapped against his face, needles every time.\\\\nThe brown zetraloid didn\\\\u2019t move though and remained in his spot, watching with a smirk as the water battered him and filled his throat with ice cold waves. Water splashed into his eyes then his head dipped back under.\\\\nDomino\\\\u2019s cold limbs were unresponsive, rendering him unable to fight back. The black water pulled him and the branch down deeper. The light of the surface disappeared as the tree rolled, pinning him against rocks.\\\\nHis chest was painfully constricted and at last, he could no longer hold his breath. Ice water washed into his mouth as his limbs thrashed in slow ripples as his life was choked away. He crushed one transmitter against a jagged rock, tearing it open. Its hurt did not register. His numb body jerked once more as water flooded his system.\\\\nOn the bank, the others were taking a short break to assess their overall progress. Splotch was taking a few measurements and generally sizing up the tree and their next plan of attack. No one else seemed to be taking any notice of much more than simple conversation. No one aside from Snakebite that was. He\\\\u2019d known Domino had been playing by the creek and his sudden absence was troublesome. Not to mention the little zetraloid could have easily gotten in the way of Crag.\\\\nThe others muttered some similar reply of not having seen the spotted little kid in awhile. Snakebite frowned. If he knew Splotch\\\\u2019s kid, and he was pretty sure he did, then the little zetraloid had certainly gotten himself in some form of trouble.\\\\nWithout waiting around to ask more, Snakebite leaped over the log and charged up the hillside.\\\\nThe zetraloid simply shrugged as he leaned back against another tree.\\\\nChecking back and forth, he saw no sign of the small zetraloid. The others had split off to search down the slopes by now. Everyone aside from Crag anyway. If the situation hadn\\\\u2019t been so urgent, Snakebite would\\\\u2019ve asked why Crag saw no need to help, but that was the least of his worries for now.\\\\nBy now even Splotch, who had previously refused to help search, had decided to come along. Despite the others\\\\u2019 urgency, Splotch hardly seemed concerned. Crag gave him a three fingered wave before returning to his watching.\\\\n\\\\u201cHe must be in the creek!\\\\u201d Snakebite exclaimed as he followed the slope Crag had lead Domino down.\\\\nSplotch walked to the cliff tip and gazed over the side\\\\u2014nothing but black water torpedoing down and over its banks.\\\\nCrag merely shrugged and followed.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe tree.\\\\u201d Snakebite murmured to himself.\\\\nNo regard to the dangerous conditions, he rushed down the bank until he came to the closest place of access. He splashed through the shallow depths up until it was waist high. The cold seared through him like a jagged knife as he grasped the end of the log at last and clung to it. He pulled himself on top of it and balanced against the swaying current.\\\\nFrom the shore, Splotch and the others watched.\\\\nSnakebite could hardly hear Splotch anyway above the roar of water.\\\\n\\\\u201cIdiot.\\\\u201d Splotch grumbled as he returned to the log.\\\\nChances the small zetraloid was still alive were slim, but there was no way Snakebite would leave without trying. He was convinced Domino hadn\\\\u2019t run off to play. He had to be stuck out here somewhere.\\\\nHe took a deep breath and plunged over the side hanging on with one hand. At once he made out the shape of the pinned zetraloid, but there was no way to reach him. Reluctantly he returned to the surface.\\\\n\\\\u201cGet that chain over here!\\\\u201d He called, voice quivering.\\\\nBracken and Fallow, the other two working, cast a quizzical glance at each other.\\\\n\\\\u201cNo! Stay here!\\\\u201d Splotch demanded.\\\\nBracken and Fallow had dislodged the chain and ditched Splotch and Crag by now, having opted to help Snakebite as the two, once again found their way into another disagreement.\\\\nThe two wrapped the chain around their arms and began their struggle. The fierce water made it especially difficult and more than once, their progress dwindled back. The branch Domino was caught in started to surface.\\\\nFallow dug his foot into the mud as best he could while Bracken continued trying to walk the opposite way. Snakebite took his chances, pulling himself across the log again; he grabbed the spotted zetraloid by his bandanna and began dislodging him with stiff hands.\\\\nThe log creaked as it began to turn once more, rolling the opposite way. The chain snapped with a jerk, throwing Snakebite off. He held onto the small zetraloid the best he could as he struggled to pull him free, working beneath water once more. At last, he was free. He thrashed around in the water for a few moments before he was able to get upright and head in the right direction. Fallow and Bracken helped him to the bank where he collapsed to his knees, holding the limp little zetraloid close.\\\\nChappeetar Sehvin! Yaaaaaaowdy!! 13 MS word pages of greatness I am sure.

It seems....bleak.\\\\nthis was hard to write seeing as my main character was unconscious and it was sort of a transitional chapter.\\\\nSpeckle and Smudge sat silently near the stationary lump on the couch. Their brother. He hadn\\\\u2019t moved since Snakebite had first brought him here. Their mother had asked why Splotch hadn\\\\u2019t returned, neither of the two had heard his response though.\\\\nDomino was wrapped in many blankets, only part of his pale face visible. He looked dead to them; Snakebite had insisted he was just unconscious though. Day was fading into night. Dark shadows were swallowing the glistening snow outside the window and the faint jingle of bells told them the wind had kicked up slightly.\\\\nSpeckle sighed as she left her seat by the window and walked over to Domino. His current spot was right in front of a small kerosene heater.\\\\n\\\\u201cDomino\\\\u2026\\\\u201d She shook his shoulders, but he didn\\\\u2019t respond. \\\\u201cDomino!!\\\\u201d She called again louder. Nothing.\\\\nThe front door slammed against the wall. Splotch was home. Dotti was there in an instant. Speckle returned her attention to her brother and shook his arm again.\\\\nSpeckle made a face at her sister before poking at her brother again. He still had no response. Their mother and father were now in the room, no doubt with great argument.\\\\nThe two glared at each other for some time, an unspoken anger sparking between the two. Splotch would never willingly admit to any fault. Dotti was the first to give in as she sat down on the chair beside the couch, casting a weary glance to Domino.\\\\nSplotch shook his head and kicked a stack of magazines from his path before leaving to get washed up. He left a trail of mud after him all the way to the laundry room which only added to its messy appearance.\\\\nThere was hardly a moment to spare as a knock sounded on the front door. Reluctantly, Dotti left their unconscious son and went to open it. The sky was dark by now. She hadn\\\\u2019t realized how much time had flown by. She turned the handle and gave the door a hard nudge to open it. In her doorway stood Snakebite, his lithe form was rather easily distinguished next to most.\\\\nDotti frowned and put her hand to her mouth.\\\\nHe stopped. Splotch had appeared around the corner, wiping his hands on an old rag. Dotti stepped aside as he pushed by.\\\\nSplotch had slammed the door in his face.\\\\n\\\\u201cShut. Up.\\\\u201d He gave her an ice cold glare, before turning back without a word.\\\\nShe didn\\\\u2019t bother to try and reason with him any further, rather making a detour back to the room they\\\\u2019d left Domino in to watch over the little limp zetraloid. Surely life wouldn\\\\u2019t be so cruel to a zetra so young. She shook her head. The water would have been cold. Did he really stand a chance against its risks? Speckle and Smudge returned to their brother\\\\u2019s side. All they could do was wait and see. Every now and then his helmet fins would twitch, but that was it.

              " '{\"text\": \"In the fall of 2018, the Federal Government introduced Bill C-86, the Budget Implementation Act, 2018 (\\\\u201cBill\\\\u201d). This Bill, which primarily implements the 2018 federal budget plans, introduced a large variety of legislative changes to a number of laws. Included amongst the proposed changes is the modernization of labour standards in the Canada Labour Code and the introduction of the Pay Equity Act.\\\\nThe Bill received Royal Assent on December 13, 2018, and despite its adoption into law, it is uncertain when a number of changes to federal labour standards will come into force. Most of the changes affecting federal undertakings take effect upon, either a government order in council at a future date, or on September 1, 2019. Therefore, it will be important for employers to monitor any changes and ensure that their practices comply with these new changes.\\\\nThe adoption of the Bill ushers in a new framework for pay equity for federal employers. The objective of the new statutory regime is to eliminate systemic gender-based discrimination in compensation practices through proactive means. Specifically, the Pay Equity Act requires federally regulated employers with 10 employees or more to develop a pay equity plan that examines their compensation practices to identify and redress any differences in compensation between employees in the same job class. It is important to note that as long as they do not discriminate on the basis of gender, employers will be able to establish different pay rates if their systems of compensation contemplate seniority, geographic area of a workplace, merit-based compensation, etc.\\\\nThe Pay Equity Act, also creates the position of Pay Equity Commissioner, tasked with ensuring the administration of and compliance with the Act. The Commissioner has a range of powers that will allow the investigation and audit of remuneration practices of employers and unions and the ability to impose monetary penalties for violations of the Act. The Act also contemplates a dispute resolution mechanism where the Commissioner may facilitate the resolution of disputes raised by employees or their unions with respect to pay equity.\\\\nThere are also new termination considerations when employers effect a \\\\u201cgroup termination.\\\\u201d Employers will provide 8 weeks of notice of termination, or pay in lieu thereof, in such cases.\\\\nThere are also a number of new breaks and leaves under the Code. Specifically, employees will be entitled to a 30-minute unpaid break for every five consecutive hours of work, a rest period of at least eight consecutive hours between shifts, and unpaid breaks necessary for nursing or expressing breast milk.\\\\nIn addition to these new leaves, the Bill includes the elimination of most minimum service requirements. In other words, employees will be eligible for leaves (including maternity and parental leave) and holiday pay without having been employed for a minimum period of time.\\\\nAnother piece of legislation affecting employee rights is the Employment Insurance Act. Its amendments will encourage parents to share parental leave by providing an additional eight weeks of Employment Insurance if both parents share the leave. The Code\\\\u2018s amendments also reflect these changes.\\\\nAdditionally, because there is no minimum service requirement for these leaves, employers may need to reconsider their parental leave policies.\\\\nPresently, the Code provides for a minimum of two weeks of vacation and vacation pay equivalent to 4% of the employee\\\\u2019s wages in the first six years of service. After six years of service, the vacation increases to three weeks and vacation pay is equivalent to 6% of the employee\\\\u2019s wages. With the new changes in the Code, this increase will take place after five years of service. After 10 years of service, there will also be an additional increase of the minimum of vacation to four weeks and vacation pay to 8% of the employee\\\\u2019s wages.\\\\nProvision of information: employers will need to provide \\\\u201ca written statement\\\\u201d prescribed by the regulations under the Code, relating to employee rights, within 30 days of the publication of such statements.\\\\nEqual Pay: Employers must provide equivalent wages to employees who perform the same job, regardless of \\\\u201cemployment status,\\\\u201d i.e.: part-time, casual, seasonal or full-time. There are some exceptions based on the employer\\\\u2019s approach to remuneration.\\\\nTemporary Help Agencies face certain prohibitions regarding charging fees to their employees, and preventing the employee from contracting with their client. They are also subject to the equal pay provisions of the Code that apply to their clients.\\\\nWith the adoption of Bill C-86 into law, federally regulated employers will have to reconsider many of their practices and policies.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees are some of the most universally-accepted graduate degrees for management, analysis, and leadership positions.\\\\nWhile other business degrees may lead straight to a job in banking, or with an accounting firm, MBAs are employable in a huge number of settings. High finance, engineering firms, hospitals, religious organizations, universities, and start-ups all need talented MBAs.\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re looking into an online MBA, you likely have some idea of how valuable the degree can be. Perhaps your employer has asked you to pursue a higher degree, or you\\\\u2019re looking to change careers, or you have a friend who started a business after their MBA. These are all plausible steps. And in this guide we\\\\u2019re going to look at both a wide range of things you can do with an MBA, and why this is the case.\\\\nIf you already know you want to pursue an online MBA, be sure to check out MBA Central\\\\u2019s MBA rankings at the bottom of this page.\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re still up-in-the-air about pursuing an MBA, be sure to check out some of our MBA FAQs, or continue working through this guide below.\\\\nCan You Get An MBA Without GMAT?\\\\nWhat Can I Do With an AgriBusiness MBA?\\\\nWhat are the Differences Between an MBA and an Executive MBA?\\\\nWhat Types of MBAs Are There?\\\\nBefore we jump into answering what you can do with an online MBA, we need to establish the fact that MBAs can vary quite a bit.\\\\nAt a general level, there are three types of MBAs: traditional MBAs, professional MBAs, and executive MBAs. Each leads to roughly the same degree, but each varies regarding entry requirements and what are required to earn the degree.\\\\nTraditional MBAs are open to those with bachelor\\\\u2019s degrees, one year or more of work experience, and who meet other admissions requirements. Traditional MBA applications generally weight undergraduate grades, extracurriculars, and standardized test scores heavily.\\\\nProfessional MBAs are open to those with bachelor\\\\u2019s degrees, who have worked in business for 3-5 years, and who meet other admissions requirements. Professional MBA applications generally take a holistic view of undergraduate grades, standardized test scores, and what the applicant has done in their work.\\\\nExecutive MBAs are open to those with bachelor\\\\u2019s degrees, who have worked in managerial roles for 5+ years, and who meet other admissions requirements. Executive MBA applicants are normally judged most heavily on their work experience, with many programs not requiring standardized testing.\\\\nAs you can likely see in the bullets above, the three main types of MBAs are divided based on the experience-level of applicants. As professional and executive MBA candidates are required to have more experience before entering the program, they are generally required to take less foundational level coursework.\\\\nIn executive MBA settings, there is generally more of a focus on high-level decision making, case studies, and advanced concepts of business administration. In traditional MBA settings, there is generally more of a focus on foundational graduate business coursework that leads to students being exposed to a variety of business disciplines at the graduate level.\\\\nGaining an MBA is a big investment. Most graduate degree programs cost more than undergraduate coursework. The average graduate also earns more upon graduation.\\\\nMuch as other degree programs and school types vary in pricing, so too do MBA programs. Nationwide the average cost of an MBA is $60,000. From top-tier schools, it\\\\u2019s quite common for 2-year MBA programs to cost over $100,000.\\\\nWith that said, MBA graduates earn a good bit more than bachelor\\\\u2019s degree holders. With one year of work experience, MBA graduates typically make over $50,000. By year 10 of a business career, most MBA graduates make over $100,000. With that said, there\\\\u2019s great variety in salary between MBA types. MBAs in strategy earn close to $100,000 their first year out of school, while human resource MBAs typically earn about half of that one year out of school. Finally, top-tier MBA programs routinely find graduates placed into positions making over $100,000 a year directly out of school.\\\\nBesides the boost in earnings, there are a number of other ways to offset the cost of MBAs. Employees with MBAs are valuable assets, and most employers know this. If you\\\\u2019re currently employed and thinking about seeking an MBA, ask your employer if they will help you pay for the course of study. Agreeing to stay at a job for a certain amount of time after graduation in exchange for your employer paying for your course of study is a common practice with MBAs.\\\\nAdditionally, seeking an MBA online can save a good deal of money. The costs of an MBA listed above are average \\\\u201ctotal costs of attendance.\\\\u201d Total cost of attendance is not only tuition but fees for on-campus amenities, living expenses, food, and cost of commuting to school. In the case of online MBAs, most fees are waived, there\\\\u2019s no commuting to school, and most degree candidates continue living where they have (as well as working). This can greatly offset the cost of an MBA.\\\\nMBAs were some of the first degrees to become widely offered online. This is helpful because over time online MBAs have become widely excepted and even the most common path towards an MBA in business settings. As most MBA candidates are currently employed, online MBAs can offer a way to structure learning around work and life responsibilities.\\\\nWhile some students greatly prefer learning in-person, MBAs have long been built for working professionals. First catered to working professionals through night and weekend courses, as well as through correspondence (and even phone courses), online MBAs are now the norm for many students.\\\\nAs we\\\\u2019ve mentioned above, MBAs come in many formats. And while your choice of specialization will likely impact some of what you do once you graduate an MBA, just know that MBAs are commonly held by many leaders in the business world.\\\\nYou likely get the point. Once you reach the upper echelons of business, more colleagues have an MBA than not.\\\\nOf course not every MBA graduate is going to proceed to run a Fortune 500 company. But there are plenty of rewarding, lucrative, and important careers short of that level of success.\\\\nBelow we\\\\u2019ll look at some of the most common online MBA specializations, detailing what you\\\\u2019ll study if you pursue this concentration and what you can do with a concentration when you graduate.\\\\nAs you may know, many accounting opportunities require professional licensing. Exams like the certified public accountant (CPA) exam, can open many doors. What many potential accountant students don\\\\u2019t know, however, is that sitting for these exams often requires more credit hours of school than is available in an undergraduate degree. Sitting for a CPA exam doesn\\\\u2019t require a full master\\\\u2019s degree, but rather requires a handful of courses at the graduate level. An online MBA can help to satisfy prerequisites for sitting for a CPA exam.\\\\nOnce you\\\\u2019ve obtained professional licensing in accounting, a wider range of potential job opportunities will be available to you. Those that work as trust accountants generally work with trust banks or law firms. They manage a portfolio of clients who hold trusts, helps to file tax returns, ensure tracking of finances, and ensure compliance.\\\\nGeneral accountants have perhaps the widest range of employment settings. From payroll services to accounting firms, to insurance companies, accountants are responsible for providing analysis, advice on tax laws, and routine payment services.\\\\nThe final large employment group related to accounting is in audit accounting. Audit accountants check annual earnings statements, financials, and tax documents for compliance. Audit accountants may work for the Federal government with the IRS, or in private enterprise.\\\\nMarketing MBAs begin with a core selection of courses that cover accounting, finance, management, and other disciplines. Students will then proceed to focus on marketing courses \\\\u2014 generally 3-6 \\\\u2014 and in some programs a final project or practicum.\\\\nThere are a wide range of marketing positions that online MBA recipients are likely eligible for. For companies with larger online presences positions in UI/UX, PPC marketing, SEO, and branding may be available. In more traditionally marketed corporations, positions in public relations and branding are likely available.\\\\nSome of the most common positions available to those with marketing MBAs include marketing managers, marketing event managers, brand managers, and marketing communications managers.\\\\nFinance MBAs can lead to particularly lucrative careers. Mid-career professionals with finance MBAs earn an average of $109,000 a year, with top financial managers, traders, and CFOs earning multiple times that rate.\\\\nCareers that can be pursued with a finance MBA are similar to those of an accounting MBA, with a few additional options. Financial controllers are some of the most common finance-centered positions in business. They take care of financial reporting, compliance, and management within a department of a corporation. Additionally, chief financial officers generally have advanced education in financially-related subject matter.\\\\nThink you might be interested in a finance MBA?

Managers talented in software and design thinking are in high demand, leading to some of the most well-paid managerial positions available today.\\\\nAdditionally, more and more online MBA programs are adding other IT-related specializations including information security and information systems.\\\\nMBAs in information technology are likely to find employment in a range of settings, from start up environments, to large engineering firms, to governmental agencies, hospitals, and school districts.

Nothing.\\\\nWell, maybe not \\\\u2018nothing\\\\u2019 \\\\u2013 but I\\\\u2019m not sure if you want to hear about my crazy day to day, work, kids, when will Game of Thrones come back (April 2019 FYI)\\\\u2026 You get the idea.\\\\n\\\\u201cGive me a topic!\\\\u201d I thought, looking for more specific direction. And, as I had minored in my whole life and then fully mastered in college\\\\u2026 procrastination set in.\\\\nFinally, I talked about it to a dear friend and fellow fragrance lover. I asked what she would like to hear me write about. And when she said it, all I could think was \\\\u201cWELL, OBVIOUSLY\\\\u201d.\\\\nBespoke Perfumery. My first and truest love in this field, the practice that first captured my interest and then, my life. The collaborative act of co-creating a fragrance for another human being; the emotional and spiritual journey you take together olfactively. And I realized that each Fragrance Journey, the creative process of developing a perfume for one based on their most intimate memories, fears, desires, and emotions \\\\u2013 and translating this and capturing the essence of who they are and what they love into a bottle \\\\u2013 this is both vulnerable and empowering simultaneously. To wear your custom scent is to be naked before the world.\\\\nAs I started to think about this, I realized how truly this act, in many ways for many of us who were at the forefront of this artisan perfumery wave, was the gateway drug.\\\\nI found Perfumery on a fall day like any other day. I was in Boston, walking Newbury Street in between classes, and I stopped into a store called Essence. Enya was playing, crystals were laced around the bottles on the bar, and I was asked if I wanted to be anointed. It was my life before that day, and my life after that day. I was engulfed in this new world, the sensuality of it, the intimate nature of it. I had found an art form that allowed me to ask a perfect stranger about their deepest thought and childhood memories, all while I smelled their skin. Are you kidding me? I had found my CALLING.\\\\nAs it turns out, I had also found my people. Fellow fragrance lovers on both sides of that blending bar. Dawn Spencer-Hurwitz, Akuura Kulak, Paula Rigby, my oldest and dearest friend from NY joined me there (& who is also still perfuming), Mark Enos, Ida Miester on the receiving end, waxing poetic even then. It was this exploration, the deep dive I did on my own in gathering everything I could find to read on perfumery, and the blends I was collaborating on each day I came to work, each day anew, each day striking some cord, some joy in a customer \\\\u2013 I was hooked for life.\\\\nI see now with the clarity of hindsight how this space \\\\u2013 ESSENCE \\\\u2013 this incubator allowed us - babies, really \\\\u2013 the freedom to play and to create. And to see how far we could go. Yosh started at an Essense in Colorado. Many of us started playing in these arenas as it was the first access to our materials. The Body Shop perhaps opened the door \\\\u2013 we just ran through it.\\\\nI remember when I moved to California and was creating custom blends out of my tool box from Sears in 1994 that people thought (including my ever-supportive parents) that I was crazy. When I would meet people and introduce myself as a Perfumer, they had no idea what I was talking about.\\\\nThen, something happened. After years and years of being an olfactive artist, I started to hear a rumbling, which has now become a roar. In 1999 I met Mandy Aftel, who is still one of my dearest friends and whom inspires me daily. We were two crafters in a sea of fragrance industry elite \\\\u2013 and we understood each other while we stood by each other, and although our mediums differed, our hearts were aligned.\\\\nIn the years that followed I had apprentices that came and went \\\\u2013 but never truly left me. Many ended up following their own fragrance dreams, Ashley Eden Kessler, Marlene Stang, Deb Piver, Yvettra Grantham to name a few.\\\\nIn 2012 Saskia Wilson-Brown founded the IAO here in Los Angeles. I have the honor of serving as a founding Board Member, and at the very first awards, was thrilled to give the first Artisan Award. I remember clearly, as I looked out at a sea of faces that has multiplied greatly in the years since, that I felt that I had been speaking an alien language for my entire adult life, and that I had finally found my tribe that spoke in the same tongue. I feel that now, in this very moment that I type these words, that you, if you are here on this site and have gotten this far into my stream of consciousness, you speak my language too. That we are all finding each other, and how very lucky we are for it.\\\\nAnd that Independent American Perfumery is only just at its beginning.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"In Second Wave Positive Psychology, there is no light without darkness. From the ashes of tragedy or challenges, great meaning can emerge like a phoenix. Life presents difficulties or confronts with its finiteness, concurrently calling us to meaning. Answering the call to meaning can lead to resilience.\\\\nDr. Laura Armstrong, Ph.D., C.Psych., is an Assistant Professor, Clinical Psychologist, and researcher at Saint Paul University in Ottawa, Canada, in the School of Counselling, Psychotherapy, and Spirituality. She also holds a Diplomate Clinician certification in Logotherapy from the Viktor Frankl Institute of Logotherapy.\\\\nDr. Armstrong is the editor of two textbooks and the author of 31 published, in press, or submitted peer-reviewed book chapters and journal article manuscripts. She was also invited by the Ontario Ministry of Education to write a resilience brief for educators and community leaders working with children. Meaning-centred theory has now infiltrated the public education system!\\\\nIn addition to invited public presentations or media interviews to enhance resilience and community mental health, Dr. Armstrong works clinically with children, adolescents, adults, couples, and families in her private practice, Tomorrow Me Psychological Services.\\\\nDr. Armstrong is the founder of R.E.A.L. therapy. R.E.A.L. therapy combines Rational-Emotive, Attachment, and Logotherapy theory and practice within a Second Wave Positive Psychology framework. Grounded in R.E.A.L., she has developed a resilience-based mental health promotion program for school children called the D.R.E.A.M. (Developing Resilience through Emotions, Attitudes, and Meaning) program. This program has been funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Council Insight Development Grant, as well as John Wells Spiritual Care awards from the Society for Pastoral Care and Counselling Research.\\\\nThe D.R.E.A.M. program uses original music, games, artistic activities, and drama to teach skills for resilience. In its most recent adaptation, collaboratively developed with mental health practitioners, children, their parents, and teachers, the D.R.E.A.M. program was adapted to address the unique socio-emotional needs of intellectually gifted children, ages 6 to 12. Approximately 30% to 40% of gifted children experience mental illness compared to 20% of their non-gifted peers. Intellectually gifted children are more likely than non-gifted children to face bullying, social exclusion, perfectionism, and emotional, sensorial, and imaginational over-sensitivities that can put them at risk for concerns. In our research, a R.E.A.L. protocol has been found to be helpful in addressing these concerns.\\\\nFrom challenges, great meaning can arise if children have the tools and awareness to recognise it, allowing children to be resilient to mental health concerns. In the D.R.E.A.M. program, children are taught about challenging and positive emotional alarm bells as helpful indicators for unhelpful thoughts, learning about the world, or as indicators for moments in which they can mindfully experience joy or gratitude. The children learn how to challenge unhelpful thoughts through attitudinal change. They also learn socio-emotional literacy skills to build meaningful connections with others.\\\\nFurther, in the program, children learn how to choose meaningful actions, problem-solve, and use creativity to make a difference in their homes, as well as how to make a difference at both local community and global levels. For example, gifted children often worry about mature real-world issues but can feel distressed when they perceive personal impotence in response to these issues. In the program, through creative activities, children learn how to choose a major real-world issue and problem-solve ways in which they can make a difference.\\\\nDr. Armstrong has developed and validated a child meaning in life questionnaire called the Child Identity and Purpose questionnaire (Ch.I.P.) for children ages 6 to 12 (Armstrong, 2016; in The International Forum for Logotherapy). The current revised version of the measure is video-based, with each item presented online in a dramatized video clip to engage child attention and to allow early readers or children whose first reading language is not English to participate. Such a measure may be helpful for evaluating meaning-centred therapies with children and moving such therapies into the realm of mainstream evidence-based practice.\\\\nCurrently, Dr. Armstrong\\\\u2019s Doctoral and Master\\\\u2019s thesis students are carrying out research using R.E.A.L. theory, the D.R.E.A.M. program, or the Ch.I.P. with children, adults, or families. When she conducted her own doctoral dissertation research, funded by over $300,000 in scholarships or student grants (including Canada Graduate Scholarships), Dr. Armstrong explored how meaningful youth engagement in structured extracurricular activities acted as a buffer to prevent suicidal ideation in those at risk, given rural dwelling, depressive thoughts, low self-esteem, or risk behaviours.\\\\nDr. Armstrong\\\\u2019s work is most influenced by Drs. Viktor Frankl and Paul Wong. She has attended the INPM Summer Institute and regularly attends or presents at the INPM conferences. She would look forward to collaborating on research or writing projects with other INPM members.\\\\nIn addition to research, clinical work, and teaching, Dr. Armstrong has developed a recent passion for Irish dancing. Her daughter took up the activity a few years ago and conveyed so much joy that mom, dad, and toddler brother were all inspired to become Irish dancers!\\\\nDr. Armstrong also finds meaning in photography, church activities, song writing, and spending a great deal of quality time with her family, particularly outdoors.\"}\\n',\n",

He wanted to make progress towards an upgrade of the 2008 China New Zealand free trade agreement.\\\\nThere is a perception that New Zealand\\\\u2019s dairy exporters (read Fonterra) have been disadvantaged by more favourable terms in China\\\\u2019s recent FTA with Australia.\\\\nWith the discussions stuck at officials\\\\u2019 level it was essential for Key to have \\\\u201cfacetime\\\\u201d with Xi and Premier Li Keqiang to get some movement.\\\\nIn an interview with the Weekend Herald, the Prime Minister shed some light on his talks with Xi.\\\\n\\\\u201cI said to him the AIIB [Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank] was really important to you guys \\\\u2013 we were [the] first country to back you.\\\\n\\\\u201cI spoke to lots of other leaders to get support for you,\\\\u201d Key related.\\\\nKey said that was probably the \\\\u201cstrongest we\\\\u2019ve ever been\\\\u201d in top-level bilateral talks.\\\\nThe Prime Minister has played a confident \\\\u2013 if safe \\\\u2013 hand in his lengthy relationship with China\\\\u2019s senior leaders.\\\\nWhen it comes to international relations, Key\\\\u2019s greatest strength is his ability to forge personal connections with other leaders. Over eight years as Prime Minister he has got to know personally many political leaders in the Asia-Pacific region and earned the respect of China\\\\u2019s rulers for his political longevity.\\\\nBut even before he set foot in Beijing on his sixth visit to China, the state-run media had warned Key not to raise the South China Sea if he wanted to make progress on trade.\\\\nNews agency Xinhua claimed New Zealand had implicitly criticised China by stepping up its calls against militarisation and reclamations in the South China Sea. Key has not resiled from New Zealand\\\\u2019s position. But he has also been careful in his public comments while in China.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe President talked a lot about the South China Sea,\\\\u201d Key related.\\\\n\\\\u201cMost of it was off-script,\\\\u201d he said.\\\\nKey said he reiterated New Zealand\\\\u2019s position. The President said that China had a long-term interest in a peaceful resolution because regional instability would not help its economic development programme.\\\\nNew Zealand\\\\u2019s basic position is that China is embroiled in a territorial dispute. Key has not taken sides and has publicly said New Zealand wants to see the parties reach a peaceful resolution between themselves.\\\\nIrrespective of Xinhua\\\\u2019s warning, Key did make New Zealand\\\\u2019s position clear. Both sides also went on to talk trade.\\\\nKey believes that China will try to accommodate the proposal for an FTA upgrade. His pitch to Xi also focused on the \\\\u201csheer politics\\\\u201d of it \\\\u2013 even though Australia is not a huge dairy exporter and their primary focus was minerals and to a certain degree beef, everyone knew China had given a great deal to Australia on dairy.\\\\nIt will not be plain sailing. Xi is worried about pressure from China\\\\u2019s 2 million dairy farmers.\\\\nKey had earlier met Premier Li.\\\\nKey said there was a change between the two meetings.\\\\n\\\\u201cLi started saying we need all this co-investment \\\\u2013 I said we are already doing it,\\\\u201d he related to the Weekend Herald.\\\\nTwo Chinese dairy companies, Yili and Yashili, were also getting all their milk from Fonterra.\\\\nThe FTA safeguards (higher tariffs that kick in when volume threshholds are passed) are costing the NZ dairy industry more than $100 million annually. This is hurting at a time when dairy farmers are under pressure through the commodities slump.\\\\nKey said he told the President the New Zealand Government was not saying it wouldn\\\\u2019t embark on an FTA upgrade without doing more for the NZ dairy farmers, and, \\\\u201cwe know you\\\\u2019ve got the politics of the 2 million farmers.\\\\nKey said New Zealand\\\\u2019s risk is that relative to Ireland and Holland, we get a smaller share.\\\\nKey said Xi also gave him an assurance that China was not going to be protectionist, making a blunt point that Chinese consumers want New Zealand\\\\u2019s products as they don\\\\u2019t trust local products\\\\u2019 food safety.\\\\nKey also reiterated that China chose NZ as the first OECD country to do an FTA with because it wanted to demonstrate to the rest of the world it could do it.\\\\nThe reality is that China will not move on the FTA upgrade until the President gives a firm signal to the bureaucracy.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe person who will make it move is Xi Jinping,\\\\u201d Key said. \\\\u201cNot just because he is the most powerful President since Mao. But because it\\\\u2019s their system,\\\\u201d he said.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn the end if we don\\\\u2019t get there it certainly will not be for want of trying.\\\\nNew Zealand will back China to join the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) \\\\u201cshould it wish to do so\\\\u201d. That is the assurance John Key gave Chinese president Xi Jinping during a high-level meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on Tuesday evening.\\\\n\\\\u201cI said to him [the President] if China wanted to join TPP we would support China,\\\\u201d Key told the Herald.\\\\nKey earlier used his speech at Tsinghua University to stake out a public position on TPP outlining that New Zealand had been in dialogue with China on the issue for some years.\\\\n\\\\u201cNew Zealand wants TPP to expand its membership and would welcome and support China joining TPP in future should it wish to do so,\\\\u201d he told the students.\\\\nKey\\\\u2019s positioning was noted by the President in their subsequent talks.\\\\n\\\\u201cHe thanked me for that,\\\\u201d Key said. \\\\u201cHe said I have seen your public comments before and they are quite helpful.\\\\nChina has invited New Zealand to take part in the G20 trade ministers meeting which will be held in Shanghai on July 9.\\\\nKey confirmed the invitation had been extended to Trade Minister Todd McClay to join the elite gathering.\\\\nChina took over the G20 presidency in December 2015.\\\\n\\\\u201cGlobal trade plays a weakened role as an engine for economic growth as its growth loses steam. Therefore, G20 members have a strong will to strengthen trade and investment cooperation,\\\\u201d a Ministry of Commerce (MOC) spokesperson said earlier this year.\\\\nA G20 Trade and Investment Working Group was also established this year following a proposal from China.\\\\nThe meetings of trade ministers and the working group will allow G20 members to hold in-depth talks on topics including trade and investment mechanisms, global trade expansion and multilateral trading system development.\\\\nEfforts will be made to let the G20 play a bigger role in global economic and trade governance, fighting trade protectionism and driving global trade back to strong growth, said Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang.\\\\nThe two-day meeting will be held in advance of the G20 Hangzhou Summit on September 4 and 5.\\\\nChinese President Xi Jinping\\\\u2019s own public comments have been relatively bland. But he did later hail \\\\u201cunprecedented co-operation\\\\u201d between the two nations.\\\\nThe Chinese President does not give media interviews after these bilateral meetings. But a formal statement said China stands ready to work with New Zealand to seek further development of their comprehensive strategic partnership on the basis of mutual respect, equality and reciprocity.\\\\nXi proposed that the two sides enhance mutual trust, boost economic co-operation, promote people-to-people exchanges, elevate law enforcement co-operation and increase military-to-military interactions.\\\\nFrom a business perspective, Xi commented that China hopes to build a long-term agricultural partnership with New Zealand, and Chinese companies look forward to participating in New Zealand infrastructure construction.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe two sides can join our development strategies and work together to cultivate new growth points of co-operation in bio-medicine, energy-saving, environment protection and innovative industry,\\\\u201d said the President.\\\\nXi also looked forward to closer co-operation with New Zealand in the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and other multilateral mechanisms.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Contrary to some beliefs astigmatism is not a disease or an indicator of bad eyes. Astigmatism is a vision disorder that belongs to a group of vision disorders known as \\\\\"refractive errors\\\\\". Astigmatism can be expressed either due to an ovality in the shape of the eye itself, in the cornea or even in the natural lens found inside the eye. Since the cornea (the clear bulging surface in front of the eye on which contact lenses rest) is the primary refractive surface of the eye, aberrations on this tissue could adversely affect the way light enters into the eye. For example, eyes that require astigmatic corrections do not focus light rays onto a single point, which is the ideal process. This can result in the astigmatic person experiencing blurry vision. Let\\'s find out what specifically causes this disorder, what the symptoms are, how it is treated and if there is a cure.\\\\nThere are a few factors that can cause an astigmatism. Below is a list of the most common causes.\\\\nEye Trauma: Trauma to the eye, due to injury or surgery, may alter the shape of the eye resulting in astigmatism.\\\\nHereditary: Astigmatism can also be the result of a genetic trait expressed at birth. Such cases of astigmatism could potentially improve, or worsen, with age depending on the individual case.\\\\nKeratoconus: This is a vision correction disorder where the cornea becomes progressively cone shaped and thinner over time. Keratoconus is an extreme version of astigmatism. Very severe cases may require a corneal transplant.\\\\nBelow is an example comparing astigmatism vision to normal vision.\\\\nIf you or someone you know experiences any of the above symptoms consider astigmatism as the potential culprit. In these cases consulting an eye doctor would be the best course of action to take.\\\\nAlthough there are no guaranteed cures for astigmatisms there are a few treatment options available that can help correct the disorder. Here is a list of those treatments.\\\\nEyeglasses:Special cylindrical lens prescriptions can compensate for the astigmatism and improve a person\\'s overall vision.\\\\nContact Lenses:Someone with an astigmatism requires special \\\\\"toric\\\\\" contact lenses that are capable of compensating for irregularly shaped corneas. This option might be more practical for those who want a more natural look or whose job(s) or sport(s) activities do not permit eye glasses to be worn.\\\\nOrthokeratology:This is a process that utilizes rigid contact lenses which are prescribed in varying curvatures. The eye doctor selects progressively tighter fitting of the lenses depending on the corneal curvature changes that he/she wants to induce in the patient. Each progressively tighter lens is worn for specified time periods. The eventual reshaping of the cornea is temporary but effective. Orthokeratology is a highly specialized technique. Potential candidates should review a practitioner\\'s experience with this method before committing to the treatment.\\\\nRefractive Surgery:This is a surgical procedure that removes tissue from the middle layers of the cornea in an effort to reshape it and improve a person\\'s overall visual acuity. Of course this is another highly specialized method and it is selected in extremely difficult vision cases.\\\\nAstigmatism is a vision disorder that impacts millions of people globally. Although there is no guaranteed cure for it there is a variety of treatment options available as we have seen above. If you experience any of the symptoms mentioned in this article err on the side of caution and consult an eye doctor for a proper diagnosis.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"In late 2017, the NAI was given the opportunity to apply for a pilot survey program in order to run opinion polls and market research on internet users. With this chance to learn more about consumer opinions, we sent out a survey that obtained the responses of 10,000 U.S. consumers to find out more about what they think about online privacy, digital advertising, the ad-supported internet, and ad blocking. The survey was conducted January 29th to February 1st, 2018.\\\\nOur survey\\\\u2019s first question establishes the general level of concern respondents have about their privacy on the Internet. Whether the responses can be contributed to either recent high-profile data breaches, or to the growing national conversation surrounding privacy, \\\\u201cprivacy\\\\u201d was stated to be at least \\\\u201csomewhat concern[ing]\\\\u201d for 85% of respondents. Further, 50% of responses indicate that consumers are either \\\\u201cvery\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cextremely\\\\u201d concerned about their privacy. In addition, 14% indicated that privacy was not a concern \\\\u201cat all\\\\u201d. This indicates there continues to be a variety of attitudes about online privacy, but we must address the majority in the middle who are at least \\\\u201csomewhat concerned\\\\u201d about their privacy. While this first question establishes that privacy is a concern for most respondents, subsequent questions and responses from the survey further clarifies this concern.\\\\nThe survey\\\\u2019s second question asks respondents to share what they felt was the primary reason for their privacy concern on the internet: 56% indicated that hackers were their top concern; a combined 15% said that data collection by either the U.S. or a foreign government was their top concern. As a whole, concerns about data collection by hackers or government entities attribute to 72% of responses to this question. 8% of users were most concerned about website and application publishers collecting data and 7% of users stated that data collection by advertising companies was their primary concern.\\\\nThe third question then shifts to help us better understand how consumers believe their access to online content should be financed. The results show overwhelmingly that respondents prefer their online content to be paid for by \\\\u201cAdvertising\\\\u201d (67%), and interestingly this response was largely consistent across all age-groups. When this result is combined with the percentage of respondents indicating a preference for a \\\\u201cDonations\\\\u201d model (17%), the two responses account for 84% of all responses. This shows an even clearer aversion by responders to pay directly for their online content. In fact, only 15% of responses indicated a preference for a subscription or microtransaction model. An interesting parallel to note is that 15% of respondents prefer a subscription or microtransaction model, which aligns with 15% of respondents who previously indicated their biggest privacy concern as AdTech companies and online publishers.\\\\nResponses to the first three questions show individuals\\\\u2019 concern for their online privacy. But, while websites and AdTech play a role in this, albeit a minor one when compared to that of governments and hackers, question four adds further insight to this regarding choice. When asked who should make the decision concerning opting a consumer out of targeted advertising, responders largely prefer themselves to be in control of this decision, with 79% indicating that \\\\u201cIndividuals\\\\u201d should be in control. Interestingly, only 10% of respondents indicated that they prefer their browser to make such decisions on their behalf.\\\\nThe survey results reveal that while some privacy concerns are associated with AdTech companies, this concern is not nearly as significant as those associated with hackers and government surveillance. But with that, the internet is largely ad-supported, and whether they are aware of this, U.S. consumers prefer their internet to continue to be ad-supported and show a clear disinterest in their content being made available only through subscriptions or microtransactions. But, when consumers are confronted with potential privacy enhancing measures, our survey shows that they want to make this choice themselves. This is a stern rebuttal to both device and browser manufacturers and governments making privacy decisions on consumers\\\\u2019 behalf.\\\\nFinally, while ad blocking is sometimes seen as evidence that consumers are taking privacy into their own hands, the final question of the survey shows that ad blockers are not primarily used as a privacy tool, but rather because consumers find ads annoying or because they cause websites to take too long to load and the effect that load time has on data usage.\\\\nWe hope this survey, and its accompanying results, serve as a catalyst for discourse on not only our industry, but also the NAI\\\\u2019s role as a leading self-regulatory association.\\\\nFull survey results can be found here.\\\\n\\\\\"This research was made possible by Google Surveys, which donated use of its online survey platform.

Adam Bartosz in his book, Nie b\\\\u00f3j si\\\\u0119 Cygana. Na dara Romestar [Do Not Fear the Gypsy], lists only a few of these. According to the scholar and expert on Roma history, the first anti-Gypsy and anti-Egyptian \\\\u2013 as they were known at the time \\\\u2013 laws were issued in Lucerne in 1471 and barred the Roma from presence on the territory of Switzerland. At the close of the 15th century, the Roma were forbidden to follow their itinerant life style on pain of corporeal punishment and enslavement. In turn, the early 16th century was marked by anti-Roma legislation of the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, in the light of which the Roma captured on the imperial territory were subject to torture and extermination. In 1530, they were legally banished from England, and ten years later \\\\u2013 from Scotland. Expulsion acts kept been issued in the 16th century, among other countries, in Denmark, Finland and France.\\\\nIt is exactly this chronicle record as well as reports of aristocratic collections of severed limbs, noses and ears of the Roma captured during such battues, subsequently exhibited in cabinets of curiosities or in palace rooms alongside hunting trophies, recoverable from the sources as late as mid-19th century, which has inspired the work of Krzysztof Gil.\\\\nThe Polish-Romani artist has produced a species of installation, composed of a cubical room of his design and making, and of sound. In its form, dimensions and execution technique, the cubic shed put together from accidental pieces of wood and fabric alludes to traditional, humble, temporary houses erected by the legally and socially marginalised Roma. On the other hand, repeating the paradigmatic form of a gallery white cube, it constructs a literally Chinese-box situation, whence it positions the audience. Since the cubical installation, upon entrance, turns out to a self-contained exhibition space, whose darkened interior appears to be a dialectical antithesis of the space of a gallery.\\\\nInside the one-chamber room, Krzysztof Gil installed a panoramic painting. The cylindrical panorama consists of a majestic and monumental, white-crayon drawing on black background, representing a scene of game display. The image, which follows the representational convention for hunting trophies, is composed of likenesses of genteel women and men, clothed in modern hunters\\\\u2019 and their female companions\\\\u2019 apparel. All images used by the artist have been appropriated from painting of the old masters. In the surrounding darkness, the light rhythmically reveals characters, whose prototypes become identifiable as members of the surgeons\\\\u2019 guild depicted by Rembrandt, for example, or as St. Irene attending to the body of St. Sebastian from Georges de la Tour\\\\u2019s painting. The composition centre holds, amidst hunted game, a de-faced \\\\u2013 as profil-perdu painted \\\\u2013 torso of an anonymous, shut-down Roma.\\\\nKrzysztof Gil\\\\u2019s use of the convention of appropriation, historicising his piece, is at once a sarcastic comment, in the spirit of Reger from Thomas Bernhard\\\\u2019s Old Masters, on European art as a history painted in bright colours, and an accusation levelled against it. On the other hand, thanks to the sound accompanying the visible, a remote history becomes juxtaposed to the contemporary and to the artist\\\\u2019s private, family history.\\\\nThe sound-track accompanying our viewing of his panorama is fragments of a record of a conversation Krzysztof Gil conducted with his grand-mother. She tells the story of her father \\\\u2013 a musician and a brick-layer \\\\u2013 murdered after WWII in the Podhale region, because he had had the audacity to make a remark about a poorly executed work to his Polish co-workers. Upon arrival on the scene of crime, the militiamen and doctors found the event to be a misadventure. The perpetrators went unpunished.\\\\nThe artist\\\\u2019s family history, which has been combined here with an event described in a 17th-century chronicle, demonstrates that the ritual Heidenjachten are not really a closed chapter of history, and that anti-Roma violence remains a notorious occurrence. It is confirmed also by the exhibition title, which we have borrowed from a contemporary photograph found on the Internet, representing a caption on a wall of a Polish city. The paint appeared to still be wet.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"I\\\\u2019m leading a workshop today for the Investigative Reporters and Editors conference on using unnamed sources.\\\\nI\\\\u2019ll discuss points made in posts about using unnamed sources, including one on persuading people to talk for the record about difficult topics (and my 20-years-later CJR piece about one of the sources) and another on using information from unnamed sources to persuade other sources to talk for the record. I also will talk about the importance of power and eagerness in granting confidentiality, and suggest we should not quote spokespeople for powerful people and organizations without using their names.\\\\nI also mention a couple of posts by others about email encryption for journalists.\\\\nIf you already possess information the source would be curious about, use that to your advantage in approaching them. Former colleague Pete Carey approached a crucial source in New Orleans \\\\u2013 post Katrina \\\\u2013 and said, as the man was closing the door, \\\\u201cI didn\\\\u2019t come here to ask you questions, I just wanted to let you know what I know.\\\\u201d The door opened and the rest is history.\\\\nFinish every initial encounter with the suggestion that the source will want to know \\\\u2013 as time goes on \\\\u2013 what you have discovered and what you plan to publish. Of course, you\\\\u2019ll need extensive personal information to re-contact them: cell phone number, home phone number, email address, home address, office address and, perhaps, some additional info (DOB, SSN) in case you lose track. I\\\\u2019ve gotten the whole nine yards that way. In one case, we were able to track a man\\\\u2019s criminal activity using what he gave me.\\\\nDeeply background every source you approach, preferably ahead of time, and I mean scorched earth, without spooking the more sensitive ones.\\\\nSometimes my most aggressive backgrounding activities \\\\u2013 including contacting neighbors, colleagues, etc. \\\\u2013 have caused a reluctant source to contact me, instead of the other way around. People who contact you \\\\u2013 rather than you contacting them \\\\u2013 tend to be more supplicant, which can be an advantage to a reporter.\\\\nAlways ask sources for a list of their friends and enemies (sometimes this line of questioning requires subtlety). Then ask what each enemy would say about them.\\\\nNever argue with a person about their reluctances. Simply interview those fears. You\\\\u2019ll be amazed at the results of that approach.\\\\nIn extreme cases \\\\u2013 where sources must remain anonymous \\\\u2013 get them to sign sworn affidavits. An added benefit \\\\u2014 your readers will find these affiants more believe-able (see our Brock Adams investigation).\\\\nFinal point \\\\u2013 the vast majority of sources should be on the record and all methods, including ratcheting, should be employed to assure that.\\\\nThanks to Eric for adding this advice to what I offered in last week\\\\u2019s post. I also recommend reading his \\\\u201cLoosening Lips\\\\u201d handout, from the best workshop I ever attended on interviewing.\\\\nThis is an updated version of a handout for a reporting workshop I used to present more than a decade ago. I have updated it for my Advanced News Gathering class this semester at LSU\\\\u2019s Manship School of Mass Communication.\\\\nFind new \\\\u201csuspects.\\\\u201d Seek out sources beyond the \\\\u201cusual suspects\\\\u201d on your beat. If you always find yourself talking to white men, find some women and minorities who might bring a different perspective to your stories and steer you toward different ideas. If you find yourself always talking to the professionals and bosses, spend some time talking to the folks in the trenches. If you spend most of your time talking to liberals, seek out some conservatives. If you spend most of your time talking to people your age, seek out some younger or older sources. These people with different perspectives will point you to different stories. Look around the agency you cover for the people or offices that attract the least attention. Spend some time there to see if you\\\\u2019ll hear some different tips. Ask yourself each week whether you made meaningful contact with a new source. If you didn\\\\u2019t, could you have?\\\\nTalk to consumers. If you are assigned to a government or commercial entity, make sure that your circle of sources is wider than the officials of that organization. Talk to citizens who deal with that agency or business and use its services or products. If some of these consumers or citizens are organized, you should deal regularly with leaders of those organizations. You also may need to deal with some self-appointed crusaders and gadflies. Make a point of dealing with some average, unaffiliated consumers.\\\\nIdentify \\\\u201cgatekeepers.\\\\u201d Develop rapport with assistants and other \\\\u201cgatekeepers\\\\u201d who control access to important sources. These people can be important sources themselves. At the least, good relations with them are essential at times to contacting the sources.\\\\nGo prospecting. Take time to go \\\\u201cprospecting\\\\u201d for sources and stories. Take a trip or set up an interview with no particular story in mind. Visit a source you haven\\\\u2019t seen for a while or a community or agency you haven\\\\u2019t covered for a while. Go just to familiarize yourself, to take someone to lunch or chat in the office or home a while. Maybe you\\\\u2019ll come back with a terrific story you never would have known enough to pursue. Maybe you\\\\u2019ll come back without a particular story, but with some tips to pursue. Maybe you\\\\u2019ll just come back with a valuable source to contact in future stories. At the least, you\\\\u2019ll gain a greater understanding of your community and your beat. Prospecting almost always yields stories and is always time well spent. You just can\\\\u2019t tell the editor or news director in advance what it\\\\u2019s going to produce.\\\\nLearn where records are. Familiarize yourself with the paper and electronic record-keeping practices of the offices you cover. Learn which records are clearly public, which are legally confidential and which might present access disagreements. Learn which records and databases you can access online without asking for them. For records kept by someone at the agency, ask to see them frequently, whether you are using them or not. This lets sources know of your interests. Seeking records in routine stories establishes precedents when you are seeking similar records in sensitive stories. Ask for records in electronic format whenever possible. Learn who has access to the confidential records (not just in the office, but clients or members of the public who might have them).\\\\nFind experts. Learn what academic institutions, think tanks or non-profit groups might study or monitor activities in your beat. Develop them as sources, so they will notify you of reports or rumors and they will know who you are when you call for their analysis of issues and events. Learn what attachments, if any, your experts have. Biases don\\\\u2019t render an expert\\\\u2019s research useless, but you must know them and note them.\\\\nDevelop national sources. Contact national associations, academic experts and government agencies to develop sources with expertise in the subject you cover. They may provide valuable perspective for a local story. Or they may know something happening locally. They may alert you to a national trend. You can search for experts by topic at Profnet and Help a Reporter Out.\\\\nBe available. Let people on your beat know you\\\\u2019re interested in hearing tips, suggestions, complaints, whatever. Make sure they have your cellphone number and e-mail. Make rounds frequently in person and by telephone.\\\\nBe honest. Never mislead a source. Be honest about the direction a story is taking. If it\\\\u2019s going to be a \\\\u201cnegative\\\\u201d story, don\\\\u2019t bill it as something else. If you\\\\u2019re not going to write a story about a tip, don\\\\u2019t indicate that you will. This doesn\\\\u2019t mean you have to offend or worry sources needlessly. If a source is worried about a negative story, assure him you intend to make the story fair and accurate and that you want to hear his side.\\\\nBe annoyingly insistent on accuracy. If someone gives you figures off the top of her head, ask where she got those figures, then check the original source. Call back sources to confirm spellings, figures, chronologies, etc. Ask for reports, documents, business cards, personnel directories, calendars, databases and spreadsheets that can confirm spellings, numbers and other facts. This not only ensures the accuracy of your stories, it wins respect with sources (and good will that you\\\\u2019ll need if an error does slip through). It puts sources on notice that they can\\\\u2019t slip bogus figures past you. And the materials you gather for one story often will be helpful in other stories.\\\\nBecome an expert. The more you learn about the complicated issues, technology and economics of your beat, the more your sources will respect you, the harder it will be for them to BS you, and the easier it will be for you to spot good stories. Read books, articles, reports. Research online. Ask lots of questions.\\\\nAdmit you\\\\u2019re not an expert. If you don\\\\u2019t know or understand something, ask. Sources will respect your honesty, and you will learn. Also, if you fake understanding, they will catch on quickly and you will lose credibility. Repeat your understanding back to the source for confirmation.\\\\nShow interest. Sources may want to bend your ear about a matter other than what you want to talk about. Listen. You may get a good news tip. Even if the source thinks it\\\\u2019s a story and you don\\\\u2019t, show interest. However boring or annoying a source may be, however uninteresting you find this alleged tip, you don\\\\u2019t know when a little bit of knowledge might be helpful. Even if the information is completely useless, the source will appreciate your interest and may someday tell you something that is important or interesting.\\\\nTell sources of your interests. Tell good sources about stories you\\\\u2019re working on, even the ones that may not involve them directly. You may know that a source isn\\\\u2019t directly involved with an issue, but if you tell him about the stories you\\\\u2019re working on, he may steer you toward other sources who might be helpful, or he may tell you something helpful that he\\\\u2019s heard around the office.\\\\nRegard your sources as characters. You\\\\u2019re not going to profile everyone on your beat. But you might profile anyone on your beat someday. So regard them all as characters you must develop fully. Learn about their families, hobbies, backgrounds, favorite sports teams, watering holes. Note their mannerisms. Follow them on social media if they use it (and if they don\\\\u2019t, ask why). Even if you never write that profile, learning these things will bring some tips your way, as the character will tell you about something she heard from her husband or an interesting thing happening in a social group to which she belongs.\\\\nEstablish a connection. Don\\\\u2019t be afraid to show your human side. If you have children the same age as the source, commiserate about car seats or car pools or car insurance, whatever stage the children are. If he hates your favorite sports team, engage in some good-natured trash talk. If she has an illness in the family, show genuine compassion. Don\\\\u2019t fake a connection or stretch for one, but be alert for genuine ways to make a connection. If you have little in common with the person, connect by showing genuine interest in the character beyond the narrow focus of today\\\\u2019s story.\\\\nShare control. Even if a source spends a lot of time with reporters, he probably doesn\\\\u2019t feel completely comfortable facing you and your notebook. Occasionally in an interview, give him some control. Sure, you\\\\u2019re asking the questions, but answer his questions if he asks any. Listen politely as he wanders off the subject occasionally. The source will feel more comfortable answering your questions if the relationship doesn\\\\u2019t feel one-sided.\\\\nTake control. Ask your questions directly. If the source ducks a question, ask again. Whatever niceties you engage in to establish rapport, the source should understand that your interest in the relationship is receiving information and understanding.\\\\nTrack your sources. Use a spreadsheet or program such as Google Contacts or Outlook to keep track of information about your sources. Get their office phone, direct office phone, cellphone, home phone, vacation home phone. Get their e-mail addresses. Record names of secretaries, spouses, children, hometowns, former jobs, alma maters, anything you learn that might later be handy to know.\\\\nAsk for documentation. Always ask for documentation of what your sources tell you. You don\\\\u2019t have to do this in a challenging way (unless you\\\\u2019re challenging). Present it as part of your quest for accuracy. Or if the source was uneasy about discussing something for the record, say you can attribute something to a document rather than to him. Documents provide verification. They may provide details that your source can\\\\u2019t recall or did not know. They may lead you to other sources. In addition, they provide precedent. If a source gives you a document when it\\\\u2019s in her interest, it may be difficult for her to claim later that the same sort of document is not a public record.\\\\nKnow public-records laws. Sources won\\\\u2019t always give you what you want willingly. You should know what records are public and know both the Federal Freedom of Information Act as well as state public-records laws. But use FOIA requests as a last resort. Ask sources to give you records that should be public (or some that shouldn\\\\u2019t). Sometimes a direct request gets you information quickly that can take months if you file an FOIA request. You might be asked to file a request for their records, but get the records quickly in a matter of minutes, hours or days, depending on your request. Always ask informally first, especially if you have good relations with the source. Formal public-records demands are an important reporting tool, but they can be slow.\\\\nStay on the record. As much as possible, keep your interactions on the record, especially when you\\\\u2019re talking about information your sources know first-hand. Your sources should always understand that this is a business relationship and your business is gathering and reporting information. When you have to go off the record, make sure it is for a good reason. For instance, if a source is telling you something he doesn\\\\u2019t know first-hand, you wouldn\\\\u2019t quote him about that anyway, but the tip may lead you to first-hand sources. If you go off the record, make sure both of you understand the terms: Is the information for publication but not for attribution? If so, try to get agreement on a description of the source that\\\\u2019s as precise as possible. Is the discussion not for publication (if so, make sure the source knows you will try to publish it using other sources)? Before you go off the record in any fashion, tell the source you might try to get her on the record later if she says anything you want to use. And if she does, go back later with just the information or quotes you want to use, and try to get her on the record. I discussed confidential sources more extensively in a 2013 post, and will focus on the topic in a separate class.\\\\nFace the music. When you write a story that might make someone angry, show up at her office after the story runs, or call, either to ask directly about the story, to follow up or on some other pretense. Give the person a chance to sound off. If you made mistakes, admit them. If you didn\\\\u2019t, hold your ground but listen respectfully. Many sources (politicians, lawyers, coaches, athletes) are used to respectful adversary relationships and they will respect you and keep working well with you if you show the respect and courage to face the music when you\\\\u2019ve nailed them. This also is a good time for getting news tips. If someone is upset about a negative story, ask about more positive news happening in his territory. If he says the situation in his office isn\\\\u2019t nearly as bad as in another office, ask for details about the other office.\\\\nAdmit your mistakes. If you make an error (or if your organization makes an error on your turf), admit the mistake, correct it and apologize personally to those affected. People understand that mistakes happen and they respect people who take responsibility. If you weren\\\\u2019t mistaken or if it\\\\u2019s not clear whether you\\\\u2019re mistaken (such as a disagreement over emphasis, rather than a factual error), listen sincerely to the complaint. Even if you disagree, give the source her say and discuss why you told the story the way you did. Consider whether a follow-up story is warranted. If not, suggest a letter to the editor, a comment on the online story or a response in social media. Brief your editor or news director on the disagreement and how you handled it. If the source complains to the editor, you\\\\u2019ll be glad it wasn\\\\u2019t a surprise.\\\\nBeware of getting too close. If your relationship with a source moves beyond friendly to friendship, you may need to adjust the relationship. You might need to ask some tough questions that remind him of the nature of your job. You can\\\\u2019t and shouldn\\\\u2019t withdraw from community life. But if you encounter sources at church and in children\\\\u2019s sports and the like, you may need to establish some boundaries. If you\\\\u2019re unsure whether a relationship is getting too cozy, discuss it with an editor. Maybe you should discuss it with the source. The source might feel a little uncomfortable, too, and might appreciate hearing that you can cheer together at your kids\\\\u2019 basketball game Tuesday and still argue Wednesday over news coverage or access to records.\\\\nSocial media relationships. You should seek appropriate social-media relationships with sources. Follow them on Twitter if they use either personal or agency accounts professionally. Facebook is a little trickier because of language such as \\\\u201clike\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cfriend.\\\\u201d If you use your personal Facebook account professionally and your source does, too, it should not be a problem to be \\\\u201cfriends,\\\\u201d especially if you are friends with people on different sides of an issue, or different political parties or sports teams. If they have a Facebook page that you have to \\\\u201clike,\\\\u201d you can do that and note in an update on your page that you have done so not because of any particular fondness, but for the professional interest of following news from the page. Of course, if a person\\\\u2019s individual page is public, or usually public, you can just check in occasionally, as you can do with a page if you\\\\u2019d prefer not to \\\\u201clike\\\\u201d it (Facebook will tell some of your friends that you \\\\u201clike\\\\u201d the page, and you might prefer not to do that). It\\\\u2019s always a good idea to discuss your social media relationships with sources with an editor or news director, so you are on the same page.\\\\nSeems the more people you kill, the more your\\\\u2019re in the limelight.\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s what this week\\\\u2019s killer du jour wrote about the August killer du jour in Virginia, who sought the limelight by doing his killing on live television and boasting about it on social media.\\\\nI don\\\\u2019t think that media cause mass killings any more than guns cause mass killings or violent entertainment causes mass killings or mental illness causes mass killings. Our nation\\\\u2019s violence sprees have complex causes and require complex, multiple solutions that will involve legislation, regulation, voluntary action and effective enforcement.\"}\\n',\n",

I quickly made a serger cover to keep it clean and then tweaked the pattern and tutorial to make my Mom one for her birthday! This tutorial is really simple; you could customize it with applique, embroidery, patchwork, really anything. My Mom picked out the fabrics so I decided to keep it plain and let them shine.\\\\nI absolutely love my Brother 1034d serger* \\\\u2013 I use it for all my knit projects (which is pretty much everything my son and I wear) and for finishing seams on woven projects that will take a lot of abuse, like curtains, beanbags, etc. Embarrassingly, I bought it when I very first started sewing \\\\u2013 my first project was a bunch of cotton wipes for cloth diapering and I was immediately a fan. It\\\\u2019s been used heavily for the past two+ years and I\\\\u2019ve had zero issues. People moan about threading it, but it really isn\\\\u2019t bad once you do it a few times! I highly recommend it.\\\\nThe entire project is sewn with a 3/8\\\\u2033 seam allowance.\\\\n1. Draw out your side piece pattern. You can create an actual pattern piece or simply measure and cut; I measured and cut with my rotary cutter and quilt rulers so I drew a little mock-up of the shape with the measurements. Cut 4 of the shaped sides, mirrored so one is reversed \\\\u2013 2 of fusible fleece, 2 of nice fabric. Cut 2 long rectangles, 1 of fusible fleece, 1 of nice fabric, measuring 15\\\\u2033 by 34\\\\u2033. Press to fuse the fleece to the back of each nice fabric piece.\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re doing any embellishing, now is the time! On my version I put a handle \\\\u2013 it was about 16\\\\u2033 up from the front hem of the rectangle. I don\\\\u2019t actually use it very often so I didn\\\\u2019t include it in this tutorial/my Mom\\\\u2019s.\\\\n2. Lay the two pattern pieces right sides together (RST), with the straight edges aligning. You\\\\u2019re going to start sewing the longest (13\\\\u2033) side first, pivoting around so the rectangle goes along the entire side.\\\\n3. To make a nice sharp corner, stop with your needle down, 3/8\\\\u2033 from the edge of the corner. Pull up your presser foot with the needle still down.\\\\n4. Pivot the pieces around, keeping them RST. You may need to use a seam ripper or pen to smooth out the fabric underneath \\\\u2013 any excess can be pulled towards the left/back so you have a smooth line to continue sewing with the 3/8\\\\u2033 seam allowance, Continue all the way around, pivoting at each corner.\\\\n5. Lay the second side piece RST and repeat, sewing the longer 13\\\\u2033 side, up, and around. Trim any unevenness around the bottom where the panels meet. Press all seams open.\\\\n6. Trim down the seam allowance and clip each corner so they poke out better, making sure not to clip through the stitching.\\\\n7. Turn the bottom raw edge up 1/2\\\\u2033 all the way around, press. Stitch to hem, press. You\\\\u2019re done!\\\\nMy overlocker is over 20 years old and it\\\\u2019s never had a cover, not unless you call a pillowcase, folded in half and thrown on top, a cover.

I backed some of the triangles with patterned paper, and also cut patterned triangles to go on top. I stitched around all the triangles that had patterned paper.

I finished the layout with puffy heart,s and some heart and speech bubble stickers.\\\\nMy next layout was inspired by the Love You journaling tags. I love the purple, teal, red, and pink together, and added several of the cards (along with some patterned paper) as a giant layering piece. I used an angled piece of paper from Little Moments and some coordinating mist as my background, and sewed around the edges. I added a giant doily under my layers, and the adorable LOVE acrylic title. I used puffy hearts and hand-cut the heart outlines from the Speech Bubble sticker sheet.

              " '{\"text\": \"Alesis has surprised me in more than one way these past few years. I used to consider the brand a \\\\u201csecond-rate\\\\u201d Akai for MIDI controllers, likening most of their products to nothing more than budget versions of their competitors MIDI controllers.\\\\nRecently, however, I\\\\u2019ve noticed a fundamental shift in the quality, presentation and marketing that surrounds this brand, and I have to say, I\\\\u2019m thoroughly impressed. The VI series in general has been receiving quite a bit of buzz since their initial release, and for good reason. The keyboards are cheaper than most of their closest competitors, including Akai, but they pack almost all of the same features, while also packing in a surprisingly fantastic look. I\\\\u2019d even go so far as to say they\\\\u2019re some of the best MIDI keyboards available right now.\\\\nAnd now, let\\\\u2019s take a deeper look into the VI49 to see if it meets our high expectations.\\\\nThe keyboard is a followup to the popular V49 MIDI controller, which was a great keyboard overall, but lacked pads. When I first laid hands on the keys, I was immediately impressed by the feel of this keyboard. I would go so far as to say it\\\\u2019s one of the best feeling keybeds I\\\\u2019ve ever come across at the price bracket the VI49 sits at.\\\\nThe semi-weighted action feels fantastic, and everything about the construction feels well above-average. Even playing pianistically feels natural and fluid on this thing, which is something I rarely say about a MIDI controller.\\\\nThe newly-added pads feel great to the touch, and as if that wasn\\\\u2019t enough, the pads light up when tapped (looking cool is always a good thing). The color of the pads change depending on how hard they are pressed, which is a nice little touch.\\\\nOne thing I was disappointed with, however, was the sensitivity on these guys. It simply doesn\\\\u2019t live up to my standards, and what\\\\u2019s worse, I find it to be somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes, they\\\\u2019ll fire perfectly, but other times, I have to essentially slam my fingers down to get a fully \\\\u201cvelocitized\\\\u201d (I know that\\\\u2019s not the right context to use this word but cut me some slack, will ya?) sound. It\\\\u2019s great that they are velocity sensitive in the first place, but I would have preferred a slightly more consistent user experience here. This is definitely one area where competitors like Akai and Novation have a clear lead over Alesis, but I wouldn\\\\u2019t be surprised to see that gap close in future releases.\\\\nThe main function buttons and sliders on the VI49 are all backlit when enabled, giving you a really cool visual representation of what is active and what isn\\\\u2019t. There are 36 total buttons (wow!) and 12 sliders, which is honestly kind of insane. If you take the time to map all of these out, you could easily see the massive potential for this thing in terms of shaping sounds on the fly!\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s even crazier is the fact that you can use the 16 pads as effects triggers as well, making this thing absolutely inundated with options. Personally, I tend to use the on/off buttons to trigger different effects, such as rhythmic processors, reverbs and delays, and I combine that with the different synth-specific modulations and tweaks that are mapped to the knobs.\\\\nPutting those two together, you can create massive, evolving leads, delicate, automated textures, and just about anything else you can possibly imagine. In fact, the more I use the VI49, the more I come to appreciate just how many of these things Alesis has packed into the controller.\\\\nFor those of you who love experimenting with different sounds, this would almost make the asking price worth it by itself. Finally, both the mod wheel and the pitch bend feel incredible to the touch, providing just enough resistance to allow precise, professional control over their respective functions. They also sport the same powder-coated finish, making them feel very easy on the hands.\\\\nWith a MIDI controller like this, being easily compatible with all of the major DAWs out there is absolutely essential. The good news is, I\\\\u2019ve tested this controller with both Pro Tools and Ableton (the latter of which is included with the VI49!), and it functions flawlessly with both. I\\\\u2019ve read similar stories from users on a variety of other platforms, so I think it\\\\u2019s safe to say this thing is highly adaptable. With Logic specifically, I\\\\u2019m able to go from initial startup to completely mapped out and ready to go within about 5 minutes.\\\\nI\\\\u2019d say that\\\\u2019s pretty great!\\\\nAs far as connections go, the VI49 has the standard set of options, with a USB providing power and MIDI data, a MIDI out for backup applications, and a dedicated power out for those moments when you need it.\\\\nOne small but incredibly annoying quirk; around 2 weeks into owning the keyboard, the plastic USB connector broke off on the back of the keyboard. Everything still works alright, but every now and again I\\\\u2019ll lose power, or my DAW will lose connection to the controller. I won\\\\u2019t harp on this too much, though, because I\\\\u2019m honestly not the most gentle person when it comes to my gear. Still, it\\\\u2019s worth noting, as it has been rather annoying.\\\\nSo, we\\\\u2019ve established that the Alesis VI49 is a pretty great all-around MIDI controller at this point. It delivers lots of value, including features and quality rarely seen at this level, but how does it truly hold up against its biggest competitors?\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a look at a few of them, and see who comes out on top.\\\\nNovation is a pretty big player in the MIDI controller game, so it\\\\u2019s only natural to compare their product first. The LaunchKey series has been around for awhile now, and many people swear by the quality, adaptability and intuitiveness of the keyboard.\\\\nThere are, however, a few distinctive differences between the LaunchKey and the VI49. The first one is rather subjective, but I have to mention it anyways; I think that the VI49 looks a lot better than the LaunchKey. I\\\\u2019m simply not a huge fan of the chunky, plain case, and there\\\\u2019s quite a bit of negative space on the face of the keyboard as well.\\\\nAgain, I\\\\u2019m sure there are plenty of people out there who would disagree with me on this point, but I think the Alesis is a pretty attractive looking controller.\\\\nAside from that, another big consideration is the 8 sliders present on the LaunchKey. I don\\\\u2019t personally use sliders all that much, but if you\\\\u2019re partial to them, that alone might be worth opting for with the Novation keyboard.\\\\nOverall, I think the whopping 64 (!) assignable buttons on the Alesis makes it the more flexible option in the long run for most users.\\\\nYou can read our review of the Novation LaunchKey 49 right here!\\\\nAkai has built a rather legendary MIDI controller product line over the last few years, including what many consider to be the absolute best budget mini controller out there, the MPK Mini MKII. But the regular sized MPK249 is just as highly regarded, and as such it represents a huge competitor to the VI49. Again, the difference here will come down to personal preference.\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s talk faders real quick. In short, if you use them, the Akai will be the route for you to take. If, like me, you want to have the maximum number of customizable buttons, pads, and knobs, the Alesis is your horse to bet on. You\\\\u2019ll also have to read some customer reviews and see how each product fares. Akai tends to have a pretty passionate fan base that supports their products, and I should know; I\\\\u2019m one of them!\\\\nYou can read our review of the Akai MPK249 here.\\\\nFinally, we will compare the VI49 against it\\\\u2019s predecessor, the V49. While the V49 was largely praised when it first released, many cited the lack of any pads whatsoever as a huge disappointment, especially considering that there were many comparable products out at the point that did include them.\\\\nAlesis has clearly learned its lesson here, and the VI49 adds 16 velocity sensitive touch pads to the equation. Honestly, finding a V49 new in stores is a pretty challenging thing to do these days, and unless you are looking for the cheapest possible option, it probably isn\\\\u2019t even worthwhile to downgrade to the V49 at this point.\\\\nStill, if you absolutely do not care about trigger pads, the V49 remains a solid MIDI controller than can most likely be found for relative chump change on secondhand websites like Craigslist and eBay.\\\\nGoing into my purchase of the VI49, I wasn\\\\u2019t really sure what to expect. I\\\\u2019d always considered Alesis to be second-fiddle to Akai, and I wasn\\\\u2019t sure I\\\\u2019d really be swayed by Alesis so late in the game.\\\\nAlesis has released plenty of products in the past, but to be honest, I\\\\u2019ve never really given them much of a chance. Other brands just tended to have what I wanted at the time, and I never stopped to see what made these guys different.\\\\nBrand loyalty be damned, though, I\\\\u2019ve come to very much enjoy this keyboard\\\\u2019s build quality, excellent keybed, and dizzying array of customization and assignability. The keyboard isn\\\\u2019t perfect; I wish the pads were a bit more sensitive, and some people might be frustrated by the lack of faders, but overall, it doesn\\\\u2019t get much better than this for the price being asked by Alesis.\\\\n64 total assignable buttons, knobs and pads. Yep, that\\\\u2019s right.\\\\nThe Alesis VI49 is a fantastic value at $229.99, delivering a high-quality product and a highly adaptable MIDI controller that is well-suited for anyone looking for a reliable keyboard controller for studio or live use.\\\\nIf you enjoyed this article, please be sure to \\\\u201clike\\\\u201d us on our Facebook page!\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Springfield Armory unleashes its hardest-hitting XD yet.\\\\nFeatured in the December issue of Guns & Ammo, Springfield Armory has launched its full-size XD(M) in 10mm. It is being made available with either a 4.5-inch or 5.25-inch barrel.\\\\nWe have all been watching the popularity of the 10mm surge in recent months, and Springfield Armory is no stranger to the cartridge. In the July issue of Guns & Ammo, contributor Joseph von Benedikt tested the also-new TRP 10, a powerhouse of a 1911. Based on Springfield Armory\\\\u2019s TRP Operator, it, too, is offered in two-barrel lengths: 5 inches and 6 inches.\\\\nThough 1911s feel great in the hand, some of us prefer striker-fired pistols with double-stack capacities. The XD(M) delivers sending 175- to 200-grain bullets traveling between 1,050 and 1,150 feet per second. Regardless of barrel length, both can carry 15 rounds in each magazine. Given the balanced weight and the capacity, the XD(M) proved to be one of the most comfortable pistols in the caliber to shoot.\\\\nSpringfield Armory XD(M) 10MM with a 5\\\\\" barrel.\\\\nBesides barrel length, the differences between each is only with the rear sight. While both share the same red fiber-optic front, the rear on the 5.25 features and an elevation and windage-adjustable match-style target sight with the corners beveled, while the 4.5 model features a no-snag ramped combat sight.\\\\nSpringfield Armory XD(M) 10MM with a 6\\\\\" barrel.\\\\nSeemingly defying physics, the weight for each pistol is the same at 1 lb., 15-ounces. The reason for that is the long slide was given a cutout on top of the slide and behind the sight. Keeping the weight the same meant that engineers could keep parts common between the two such as the recoil spring. Though coincidence, perhaps, even the short-reset trigger pull of each gun averaged the same at 5\\\\u00bd pounds.\\\\nIn the video below, you\\'ll see Gunsite Instructor Chris Currie walking through the \\\\u201cDonga\\\\u201d with the Springfield Armory XD(M) 10mm.\\\\nLike other XD models, this XD(M) 10 is friendly to left-handed shooters. The aggressive texture, interchangable backstraps, grip safety, trigger and balance are not biased. Even the magazine release button is a true ambidextrous control. There is not disassembling the pistol to change the orientation of the button on this. It\\\\u2019s two sided and functions reliable from either side.\\\\nFollowing Springfield Armory\\\\u2019s own 10,000-round torture test using Federal Premium Hydra-Shok 10mm loads (www.xdm10k.com), contributor and pro-shooter Chris Cerino evaluated it for G&A and experienced perfect reliability during his tests of both variations. From a 25-yard bench, he demonstrated the pistol\\\\u2019s accuracy potential by printing groups that ranged from an average of 1.41 inches with 180-grain ball to 2.33 inches with more powerful defensive loads. This pistol is a shooter.\\\\nG&A editor Eric Poole joined Springfield Armory pro-shooter Rob Leatham at Gunsite to test and evaluate these pistols and more. Tune in to Techsperts\\\\u2122 on the Sportsman Channel in November and December 2018 to watch Poole and Leatham shoot through Springfield Armory\\\\u2019s family of XD pistols at Gunsite.

WINNING WRITERS\\\\u2019 NEWSLETTER: maintains a DATABASE of writing contests.\\\\nJAMIE: The name of your blog, Shadow Dancing With Mind, is evocative. How did you come to it?\\\\nSHASHI: Most of the time, we don\\\\u2019t differentiate between the inner-self and the mind. We believe that we are the mind that is taking input from sense organs not the one that is beyond the mind, that one aspect which thinks. Over the centuries, many philosophers have thought about this, including our own ancient Indian scriptures like the Vedas, Puranas and Bhagwat Gita and realized that it\\\\u2019s not the body but some thing beyond the physical existence, does exist. Some call it sub-consciousness, inner-self, soul etc. Ren\\\\u00e9 Descartes tried to make that point in his famous quote \\\\u201cI think, there for I am.\\\\u201d I firmly believe in this inner-self existence and the blog\\\\u2019s name came from the process of that exploration. As mind thrives on chaos, flitting from one thought to another, one pleasure to another, it was a hard journey. Every time I am reaching closer to inner-self, mind throws up new chaos, sense pleasure or flood of desires, emotions or cravings in order to divert attention\\\\u2026 hence I ended up shadow dancing with mind as they do in the popular sports boxing, fighting with one\\\\u2019s own shadow\\\\u2026.\\\\nJAMIE: You clearly love poetry and are a fine poet, but have chosen to cover multiple subjects, to do articles as well as poems, and to use a magazine format. What made you decide to do this instead of a strictly poetry blog?\\\\nSHASHI: I am passionate about reading, writing, and photography and have been working in the field of interior design for a long time now. I realize that it\\\\u2019s all about creativity, a way of expressing your inner-self. It\\\\u2019s just that in all these forms the medium or the language of expression is different. That is one part of my blog where I do manifest my thoughts in physical form in terms of poetry, haiku, or a book that is serialized, Yogi Baba \\\\u2013 A Story Untold.\\\\nThe other part of the blog is about sharing. I wanted to share - my thoughts, ideas and creativity - but also what has influenced me over the years. Maybe this will help some one somewhere some time to give expression to their feelings, emotions, and creativity. Perhaps it will influence or trigger their creativity as it has influenced my thinking. Even if one person who gets inspired by my features at blog about books, music, artists, movies etc, I would probably achieve, what ultimate cosmic design has intended me for this life time.\\\\nThere are so many beautiful things to admire, live, and touch in this beautiful life, this beautiful world. Some times I feel that I am not doing enough too; but then through this blog, at least I am going somewhere \\\\u2026 even if in little steps.\\\\nJAMIE: Are the photographs on you blog - which are fabulous, by the way - yours? What comes first the poem or the picture? Or do they feed each other?\\\\nSHASHI: Most of the photos on the blog are of my own on the posts that deal with my creativity. When I feature others from net I attribute the source.\\\\nAs I started my journey through the search of inner-self, I travelled to amazing places as I believed that travelling is meditative. The Himalayas, nature, rivers, sea and powerful spiritual places like temples, churches and mosques and so on were places that attracted me. In the beginning, I started taking pictures, to give form to those beautiful experiences that I have had. Slowly I realized that the photographs are inadequate to capture the true essence of my experiences. They gave those powerful places, nature, and emotions a body but not a soul. So I started writing poetry, free form of haiku, thoughts etc. Now, after many years of personal experience, I realize that for me (it\\\\u2019s my specific nature) writing is more fulfilling. Photographs are about past, reliving moments and connecting with them, whereas writing is living that moment in that present.\\\\nThe best advice I can offer to friends about photography is that it\\\\u2019s not about taking pictures. It\\\\u2019s about connecting with that particular present. Take picture of any moment, after living in that present. See through your eyes first, live in that moment, totally immersed, and then try to capture what you see, not what the camera lens is showing. Focus on seeing not on taking pictures. Photography is not about the camera, it\\\\u2019s about your seeing eye.\\\\nIn sum I am passionate about any form of creativity, designs, reading books, travelling, and I love taking pictures. Today, if you ask me, where I am. I am not sure yet, but I am experimenting with and living the life of Karma Yogi. As, I have still not found the right path or the right reason for me. I am practicing Mantra Yoga for peace and positivity in life too. (I actually started teaching the path of Mantra Yoga for meditation to few of very deserving and dedicated people online as well).\\\\nBy way of explanation: Being a Karma Yogi means \\\\\"do what comes to your table with your 100% sincerity and hard work and then don\\'t worry about the results.\\\\u201d The key point here is \\\\\"what comes to you\\\\\" as ourselves, being the part of Universal Consciousness, will attract only right things for us to do. I again firmly believe, is that what is good, or required by Universal Consciousness for us to do, will come to us on its own as our nature will attract it towards us. The second part is \\\\u201cdon\\\\u2019t worry about the results,\\\\u201d which means that worry is negative and it will end up attracting negative things for you so you should not worry about things that you have finished doing. This is especially so if in the first place you have had already given your 100% to the work, situation, or things at your table. If you worked hard and with dedication, you could not have done any better. In that case, what is the point of worrying?\\\\nJAMIE: Thank you, Shashi, for sharing your unique perspective with us today.\\\\nFrom 10.01 a.m. Monday December 27,2010 until 10:01 a.m. Saturday January 8, 2011 (CST), think about what you want to have, do and wish for this upcoming new year.\\\\nAfter that, use them to create a poem, short fiction, prose or anything you can think of and link them in right at this post!\\\\nShare your dreams, wish list and wishes over here as the new year comes greeting on us!

Which do I choose? A tough decision.\\\\nFinally, for this week, I decided on Lovely Annie\\'s Untitled - Shadorma. It deserves special attention because of both subject and technical competence. As value added, Annie introduced us to Shadorma, which is a poetic form new to me and I image some others as well.\\\\nThe Shadorma is a syllabic poem of Spanish descent.\\\\nIt is a sestet with no rhyme scheme. 3/5/3/3/7/5.\\\\nEach Wednesday we try to highlight some of the talented individuals who contribute their time, poetry and words of encouragement. This week we get to meet Daniela Miller a.k.a. Flying Monkey.\\\\nI\\\\u2019m originally from Germany, Saarland more specifically, which is a tiny county at the border to Luxembourg and France but I\\\\u2019ve been living in the southeast of England for 6 years now. During a sabbatical in 2003/04 I was first backpacking through Australia and then living and working at a Buddhist centre in London. I met my husband there and consequently decided to stay.\\\\nI am a practising Buddhist and try to spend some time on retreat with my teacher Dzogchen Patrul Rinpoche every year.\\\\nAs for earning a living, I have always worked with children and young people. I have a soft spot for underdogs and the kids that feel like (or most often are made to feel like) they don\\\\u2019t fit in, i.e. I worked with young asylum seekers and immigrants in Germany and in England mainly with children with emotional, behavioural and social difficulties, ADHD, Autism etc. I\\\\u2019ve learned so much from these kids.\\\\nRecently I have been working in a more strategic role setting up projects for children and young people but will be made redundant at the end of March so who knows what will come next. I\\\\u2019ve started training as a Homeopath and hope to start practising it in a few years time.\\\\nAs a character I\\\\u2019m friendly and curious. I get bored very easily and always need change and new ideas that grab my attention. I love animals and travelling and sometimes think that I would have made a great female David Attenborough. I\\\\u2019m on a journey and hope to be able to help others along theirs.\\\\nPlease tell us about your blog, and what it means to you.\\\\nStarting my blog was one of the scariest things I\\\\u2019ve ever done. When I started it, I was recovering from a writer\\\\u2019s block that had paralysed my creativity for several years, if not decades. I had no confidence whatsoever and no idea what to write or what about. All I knew was that I needed to write.\\\\nIt was a prompt over at Sunday Scribblings that made me write my first post and I have since then responded to prompts from several online communities. Somehow that\\\\u2019s my antidote to the writer\\\\u2019s block. I let go of the responsibility to decide what to write about and just go with the flow of the prompts. Sharing my poems at first anonymously with an anonymous online community made me feel safe and helped me to put myself out there. I can\\\\u2019t even begin to express how grateful I am to all the people who have since commented on my posts, made me feel welcome and held my hand while I was learning to walk on very wobbly legs. It\\\\u2019s been amazing and I slowly feel like I\\\\u2019m finding my feet.\\\\nCan you remember writing your first poem? Can you tell us a little about it?\\\\nThat was as a teenager but I can\\\\u2019t remember the very first one. I was writing a diary anyway and then started to write poems as well. I never showed them to anyone, though.\\\\nWill you give us some insight into your style of writing, or the style/form you prefer.\\\\nI like rhyming but I don\\\\u2019t think I\\\\u2019ve found my style yet. I admire poets who write beautifully flowing poems that don\\\\u2019t need to rhyme at all.\\\\nAre there any styles of poetry you find difficult or annoying, and why?\\\\nI\\\\u2019m struggling with Haikus. I don\\\\u2019t know why. I think I just don\\\\u2019t get them although I have come across one or two brilliant ones that just said everything there was to say in a few little words. So there\\\\u2019s hope. Who knows, maybe one day I try myself at one.\\\\nYes, I also just ramble sometimes on my blog.\\\\nBut what I would really like to write as well as poems are stories. But there\\\\u2019s a genre specific writer\\\\u2019s block in that area that I haven\\\\u2019t been able to lift yet. Maybe I\\\\u2019ll join a course or something to get myself going? Any ideas or advice on how to get started for a story virgin like me?\\\\nWhat poem, written by you, do you like the most, and why?\\\\nI generally prefer poems to poets. There isn\\\\u2019t a poet of whom I could say I like everything or even most of what he or she writes (myself included) but there\\\\u2019s lots of poems by different poets that I love.\\\\nNo, but I think it would be nice to have one.\\\\nDo you have a favorite place to write? Are there certain emotions that inspire or trigger writing?\\\\nI don\\\\u2019t have a favourite place. I write a lot at night and I prefer writing on a PC to hand writing because it\\\\u2019s so much easier to play around with the words and change things.\\\\nBecause I\\\\u2019m mostly writing in response to prompts, whatever needs to be expressed finds its way into the post, so no, there aren\\\\u2019t any specific emotions that trigger my writing.\\\\nI like all sorts of music and it depends on my mood. When it comes to dancing however, it\\\\u2019s definitely house music.\\\\nI don\\\\u2019t have a favourite book but I do have favourite authors: T.C. Boyle, Hermann Hesse and Paulo Coelho. I like almost everything these three have ever written.\\\\nDo you have a favorite quote that inspires you or your writing?\\\\nI actually came across a fabulous writing quote shortly before starting my blog and it is now one of my favourites because it is so true: \\\\u201cThe worst thing you write is better than the best thing you didn\\\\u2019t write.\\\\u201d Unfortunately I don\\\\u2019t know the author of it.\\\\nNo, not yet. But who knows what might happen.\\\\nIf you could have dinner with any famous deceased person, who would it be, and where would you dine?\\\\nI\\\\u2019d love to have joined Hermann Hesse and his writer friends for dinner at his house in Montagnola, Switzerland. I can only imagine the inspiring conversations they have had.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Gutter and downspout cleaning is a job that is best committed to a qualified professional for a variety of reasons. If you are looking into cleaning your gutters yourself then you need to take a minute to think of whether or not this is really the very best course of action. Is it worth you getting injured? Not only is it a really demanding and grimy job, however it\\\\u2019s in addition extremely not likely that you are going to be able to do as great of a job as one of our fully committed workers at Clean Pro Gutter Cleaning\\\\u2122.\\\\nNo matter how diligent you are, standing on a ladder with a bucket and a water garden hose isn\\\\u2019t going to get your gutter and downspout as clean and clear as they would be if you had the experts get the job done for you. Give us a ring immediately.\\\\nOne element of employing a skilled professional to clean your gutters that you might not have thought about is a professional will examine your gutters as they clean them. Chances are that you don\\\\u2019t understand what to look for if you are trying to identify smaller gutter problems before they end up being huge ones. But, if you employ us to clean your gutters for you, then we ensure you that the skilled professional we send out will completely inspect your rain gutters for you.\\\\nWe are a safe, reliable choice that knows exactly how to get your gutters cleaned before they trigger any issues.\\\\nOur Gutter Cleaning service technicians are friendly and qualified. We work carefully and meticulously and are completely insured. We never ever rest ladders on your gutter systems or leave scuff-marks on your wood deck from a rain gutter clean-up. Our service will never jeopardize your landscaping. After the completion of your cleaning, we will be sure to inspect the yard and leave it in a much better condition than when we showed up.\\\\nDependable \\\\u2014 We get the gutters cleaned out quickly. We work hard to make sure we are able to get to the gutter cleaning service prior to the scheduled date. We can\\\\u2019t always do that, but we always try our very best to make it happen.\\\\nEconomical \\\\u2014 While we usually are not the cheapest around, we endeavor to make sure all quotes are fair. We evaluate our rates frequently to make sure we are offering a fantastic value for our customers.\\\\nIf you think that the expense of gutter cleaning is too expensive, then you most likely do not understand just exactly how vital it is to have an experienced professional company, clean your rain gutters. Depending on the kind of material utilized, gutters and downspouts can last for several years and even a life time. But the catch here is that they must be maintained. You can\\\\u2019t count on anything to last for any length of time if you do not take care of it. This is specifically true when it pertains to your gutters and downspouts.\\\\nRain gutters are created to be strong and lightweight. They are attached near the top of your home to a fairly thin board called a fascia. Because of this, they should not be any much heavier than is essential. What do you believe occurs if you permit rancid debris to build up in them over time? Even if a clog never forms you are still placing extra pressure on the rain gutters. This weight might not be much, but through months or years, it can do a great deal of damage.\\\\nIf things are permitted to advance to the point where an actual clog is formed, then things can take a fast turn for the worse. An obstruction causes water to become trapped, where it can easily saturate and seep inside your home. In case you didn\\\\u2019t know it, water within your home is not a good idea. An obstruction through the winter season can also cause the development of a frozen ice dam. An ice dam is merely trapped water that freezes. Ice dams are especially harmful since they grow gradually, and will typically cause your gutters and/or downspouts collapsing.\\\\nWhy care about all of this? In a word, the all mighty dollar. If you are procrastinating working with a gutter cleaning service just because you are attempting to save a dollar, you are going to be in for a shock when the time comes to change your gutters and downspouts.\\\\nMake no mistake about it, if you don\\\\u2019t clear, clean and maintain your rain gutters then you will end up needing to remove and replace your gutters sooner than typical. This can lead to a bill that varies between anywhere from a thousand dollars ($1,000) all the way up to close to ten-thousand dollars. That\\\\u2019s a lot more money than the cost of gutter cleaning.\\\\nThe bucks to work with a professional gutter cleaning business is going to vary depending on a variety of aspects. Recognizing these aspects can help you to see if you are getting a good deal, or if a company is attempting to take advantage of you. The price that a competent professional is going to invoice to clean and maintain your rain gutters and downspouts will mainly depend on how many stories your house is, and the feet of gutters needed to have cleared, cleaned and maintained.\\\\nSo, exactly what is the typical expense to clean gutters in different homes with various lengths of gutter systems ? The following examples ought to offer you an idea of what the market average prices are. Let\\\\u2019s say that you have a single-story home with 150 feet of rain gutters and downspouts. In this case, you should be looking at an average cost of $135 to $200. What about a single-story home with about 180 ft. of rain gutters? In this case, you ought to be looking at a cost of about $175 to $225. If you have a two-story home with around 200 feet of gutters you are going to be looking at a typical cost of about $ 197 to 277 usd.\\\\nAnother element that will enter into play when figuring out the cost to clean gutters on your home is the type of landscaping you have. If your home has a lot of trees, bushes, and other landscaping that make it more difficult to gain access to your rain gutters, then this will usually wind up making the rate for your gutter cleaning to go up. This shouldn\\\\u2019t be surprising since anything that makes a gutter cleaning company to take more time and effort while dealing with your home would logically make the job more expensive for the house owner.\\\\nNow, if the gutter cleaners you choose quote you a higher rate, you do not necessarily need to panic. What you must do is ask them why the rate is greater. There are a variety of reasons why a gutter cleaning business might justify charging you more. If you understand those reasons then you will have the ability to figure out if you are being overcharged, or if your expense is in fact fair.\\\\nThe primary variable triggering your rain gutters cleaning invoice to be greater is if your rain gutters and/or downspouts have been neglected for a long period of time. Gutters that are excessively nasty are going to take a lot more labor to clean and maintain. So, it stands to reason why your bill would be higher. After all, you honestly would not expect a business to do additional work for totally free, would you?\\\\nAnother thing that can cause your gutter cleaning quote to be higher is if you have gutter guards in place. What are rain gutter guards? Gutter guards are various kinds of devices that people have in place to attempt to keep yard waste from getting in their rain gutters. Whether or not having gutter guards is worth it is betwixt and between. What isn\\\\u2019t uncertain is the fact that having gutter guards is going to lead to a greater rain gutter cleaning charge.\\\\nWhen you have rain gutter guards they need to be removed and then replaced once again after the cleaning process is done. This in a nutshell comes down to the similar issue as having exceedingly grimy gutters.

The role of a Minister of the Word is to make the Liturgy of the Word as meaningful as possible for the assembled congregation. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal reminds us that when the Sacred Scriptures are read in the Church, God himself speaks to his people, and Christ, present in his own word, proclaims the Gospel. During the liturgy the reader is fulfilling a mission to his or her fellow community members. It is a sacred duty that involves a sharing of one\\'s own faith.\\\\nIt is therefore a great priviledge to read the sacred scriptures at Mass. It is also an personally enriching, fulfilling and spiritual experience. If you have been given the gift of a good voice (which can be trained to sound better) and a good sense of reading aloud (which can be trained to interpret better) you are equipped for the Ministry of the Word.\\\\nAt present there is a panel of 40 parishioners who are Ministers of the Word in St. Mary\\\\u2019s Parish. More would be welcome. The commitment involves preparing for and reading the sacred scriptures at the Mass each Sunday (or Saturday vigil) for one month every three months. The quarterly schedule is drawn up on the basis of the Mass time(s) preferred by each Minister of the Word. (If a Minister of the Word is available to read at a week-day Mass that is an added bonus). An objective of the Ministry is to extend its appreciation of this most vital of ministries from a mechanical process of reading God\\'s word to one of deep reflection, careful preparation and powerful, expressive proclamation of Gods\\' word. Periodic opportunities are therefore provided to Lectors to improve the quality of their preparation and reading of God\\'s Word.\\\\nIf you feel that you might be interested and that you may have the gifts needed to take part in this important ministry please contact the schedule coordinator or the Parish Office and you will be contacted as soon as possible.\"}\\n',\n",

Again, still not many answers on those fronts. That said, audiences wondering if Ariana Grande was going to cancel her upcoming Wicked performance in light of recent events can probably let out a collective sigh of relief. Choosing not to perform would have been completely understandable, but per Grande\\'s first tweet following rumors of a breakup between her and Pete Davidson, it doesn\\'t sound like that\\'s the case.\\\\n\\\\\"honored to be included in this celebration of 15 years of my favorite musical of all time [heart] wouldn\\'t miss it for the whole universe\\\\\"\\\\nAppropriately, given the context, Grande finished up her Monday morning tweet with a hashtag celebrating the musical and its widely praised Broadway legacy: \\\\\"#wicked15.\\\\\"\\\\nBack in September, pop music fans and musical theater aficionados alike were pleased to learn that plans for a televised Wicked anniversary concert (celebrating 15 years of fantastical, foot-tapping goodness on the Broadway stage) were well underway at NBC. Aptly titled, A Very Wicked Halloween: Celebrating 15 Years on Broadway, the show will feature a string of Wicked-y performances from former cast members as well as additional musicians, like Grande. NBC\\'s anniversary concert program is set to air the weekend before All Hallow\\'s Eve, on Oct. 29.\\\\nJudging by Grande\\'s tweet, it seems pretty safe to say she\\'s doing everything she can to make sure this particular performance (which seems to hold special import to her) comes to fruition the way she intends it to. Plus, judging by the tweet\\'s accompanying photo, it looks like Grande might\\'ve offered fans a little pre-show teaser ahead of NBC\\'s actual Wicked concert to amp up the excitement. What\\'s that? Well, nothing\\'s been confirmed, but the script pictured in Grande\\'s tweet does seem to suggest pretty strongly that she\\'s going to perform \\\\\"The Wizard and I\\\\\" \\\\u2014 Elphaba\\'s iconic opening song in the musical \\\\u2014 at the upcoming anniversary show.\\\\nOK, so the question of whether or not Grande is planning to cancel her Wicked appearance seems to be, more or less, taken care of. But, alas, a medley of additional ones still remain. Like, did Grande and Pete Davidson break up? When is she returning to the stage for good? Is Grande OK?\\\\nOver the weekend, the singer\\'s fans were concerned when she cancelled her performance at a F--k Cancer fundraiser, after having taken some time off professionally in the aftermath of her ex and close friend Mac Miller\\'s untimely death in September.\\\\nThen, hardly a day later, reports surfaced that Grande and Davidson split up. As fans of the couple know, Grande and Davidson first started dating around five months ago, around May 2018. By mid-June, the pair had announced their engagement via Instagram. And while neither Grande nor Davidson has commented on the recent wave of breakup rumors, according to an unidentified source who spoke to People, \\\\\"[The relationship] was way too much too soon. It\\'s not shocking to anyone.\\\\\"\\\\nAgain, it seems important to reiterate that neither Grande nor Davidson has commented publicly on the breakup rumors just yet, so it still feels possible that the rumors are just that. However, if those reports do turn out to be true, then let\\'s hope that Grande is focusing her energy on what\\'s most important: Taking care of her physical, mental, and emotional health. If she\\'s able to croon her way through a Wicked banger on national TV in the process, far be it for her fans to complain.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Will Enrique Pe\\\\u00f1a Nieto, the new president of Mexico from the corrupt and authoritarian Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), go easy on drug traffickers? Let\\\\u2019s hope so.\\\\nDuring his campaign, Mr. Pe\\\\u00f1a Nieto vowed to battle murder, extortion, kidnapping, and other violent crimes but said little about going after drug traffickers. During its unrivaled 70-year reign that ended in 2000, the PRI was accused of cutting deals with crime syndicates to keep the peace. Although such agreements were corrupt, perhaps corruption is better than the militarized U.S.-backed anti-drug war of Felipe Calder\\\\u00f3n, the current Mexican president. Fatigue with that costly war, which has killed more than 50,000 Mexican civilians in recent years, played a significant role in Mexicans bringing back a venal and autocratic PRI that they had thrown out of office 12 years before.\\\\nBut any president of Mexico must pay heed to the wishes of the colossus of the north, and Washington is already suspicious that Pe\\\\u00f1a Nieto will ease the pressure on drug traffickers and stop taking down cartel chieftains.\\\\nOf course, most Mexicans would be happy if Pe\\\\u00f1a Nieto did exactly that. At the behest of the United States, Calder\\\\u00f3n\\\\u2019s use of the Mexican military and its harsh tactics against the drug lords has merely led to the slaughter of Mexican civilians without putting much of a dent in the long-term flow of drugs into the United States.\\\\nThis militarized bloodbath is causing some in the United States \\\\u2014 even a few government officials \\\\u2014 to privately reassess the failed U.S. war on drugs. As during alcohol prohibition from 1919 to 1933 in the United States, organized crime has been given a big boost; continued demand for the illegal product exists and so do huge profits to be made off excessively high prices that could be charged for the dangers of smuggling it to customers past government authorities.\\\\nMexicans correctly believe that the root of the problem lies in the continued demand for illegal drugs in the United States. If the U.S. government did away with a victimless crime and allowed adults the right to put into their bodies what they wanted, demand for drugs would go up somewhat but the violence would plummet. No one would pay elevated prices to gangsters \\\\u2014 Mexican, Colombian, American, or otherwise \\\\u2014 to traffic legal substances. Society could then treat drug addiction as a medical problem instead of a crime, with education campaigns and treatment programs reducing the long-term demand for drugs. Finally, the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, but that\\\\u2019s because many of the people in prison are being held unnecessarily for drug-related crimes \\\\u2014 that is, jailed for consuming or trafficking substances that shouldn\\\\u2019t be illegal in the first place. Legalizing drugs would eventually lower the U.S. prison population by getting rid of those faux crimes and also by reducing the robberies and violence associated with stealing money to pay inflated prices for what is now illegal contraband.\\\\nSo until the United States adopts the enlightened policy of drug legalization \\\\u2014 don\\\\u2019t hold your breath \\\\u2014 the Mexican government is faced with the unpalatable options of knuckling under to U.S. pressure to continue the rising slaughter and instability of a militarized drug war or cutting a deal with cartel leaders to ensure peace. As bad as it seems, the latter alternative is better for Mexico and the United States. More drugs may get through into the United States, but the killing and instability just south of the U.S. border, which is coming north, would be reduced.\\\\nIn short, corruption is better than slaughter. The U.S. government took this route in Iraq by paying off its enemies, the Sunni Awakening guerrillas, to stop attacking American forces and turn on their even more violent al-Qaeda brethren. Violence was reduced, and the U.S. military was able to extricate itself with honor from a bloody quagmire. Similarly, Pe\\\\u00f1a Nieto may adopt the traditional way the PRI has dealt with drug lords in Mexico, reaching agreements with them to ensure the peace and extracting the Mexican military from an equally bloody and fruitless fight. If Pe\\\\u00f1a Nieto pursues this course, the U.S. government will likely unfairly and hypocritically criticize him for doing so.\"}\\n',\n",

Well, the following information may help you.\\\\nSome notes on the horn are vented by one or more open toneholes directly following, some notes are not. The notes that are not, like D, E, A, middle and upper C- have to deal with relatively less venting than those with more than one open tonehole directly following, and this can sometimes affect intonation or the relative stuffyness of the note.\\\\nA simple example- low E only has one open tonehole directly following it (the D tonehole, the Eb is closed, then the low C follows), and thus less venting. Great, so open up the D tonehole to give it more venting. Problem: now F is sharp. Therefore, compromise is needed. Through tonehole positioning and tonehole sizing, a reasonable compromise can usually be found, but sometimes not without auditory evidence. Like middle C. It sounds way stuffier than side C- hence the old-timers calling side C \\\\u201cballad C\\\\u201d.\\\\nFor a simple test that will illuminate this principle, play F and slowly lower your D key.

Even thousands of miles away from the host of the event, Atlantida EcoVillage in the south of Colombia, we heard the call, and marked it on our calendar, a source of inspiration waiting for us in Colombia. We did everything to get there.\\\\nOf course it wasn\\\\u2019t easy, as the nomadic life is full of surprises and challenges\\\\u2026 we were in Mexico at the time, and had to cross half the continent, through Central America and the Panama Canal to South America. It was months of hard work and many adventures traveling through 6 countries, visiting projects, editing materials, raising money to support the project ... with the passage of our pilgrimage to the south, the gathering became almost a mythical destination for us, always giving us direction and motivation to make it to South America.\\\\nWhen people asked us how long it took to arrive at the Llamado, the response of 15 months seemed like a joke, but it was the truest answer we could give! More than a year ago we designed our route and plans to arrive in time for the gathering. Minhoca, our beloved motorhome, has her own rhythm, and is a bit slower and more complex than a normal car, bus, etc.... We had multiple problems with both of our fuel systems (propane and gasoline), and we had to make the most difficult crossing of the trip, crossing the Panama Canal, and then cross the entire length of Colombia to get to Atlantida.\\\\nAfter a successful crossing into Colombia, we took a break on our way South, storing Minhoca with our dear friends Kawak and Sandalo in their beautiful ranch in Antioquia\\\\u2026 The two then joined us on the way to the Llamado.\\\\nS\\\\u00e1ndalo, Ryan, Kawak, Minhoca and the dogs!\\\\nIn early January the four of us set out towards the gathering, finally approaching the event that we had looked forward to for so long. Two more friends joined us in Cali, Katie and Blitz, who had flown down from California to travel with us for a few weeks and participate in the gathering. We headed out the 6 of us, still with severe mechanical difficulties: the engine was so weak that during the long uphill climbs on the way we couldn\\\\u2019t manage more than 5 miles per hour \\\\u2026 a pedestrian walked faster than us! But finally, we reached Atlantida at midnight on January 4, exhausted and relieved.\\\\nThe first two days before the event, January 5-6, we participated in a conference of ENA, the EcoVillage Network of the Americas. ENA is a branch of GEN, the Global EcoVillage Network, and was founded in the 90\\'s to connect projects and create a network. ENA was created in a different era of the EcoVillage movement and, recently inactive, called the meeting to take a look at the future of the organization and how to accompany the growth and transformation of the EcoVillage movements in the Americas.\\\\nOut of this meeting came the proposal to create C.A.S.A., a new organizational platform to include EcoVillages, Eco-Caravans, EcoBarrios and other Urban Sustainability projects. CASA means Consejo de Asentamientos Sustentables de las Americas, or Council of Sustainable Settlements of the Americas, and is a new organization that will work alongside ENA, amplifying relations with parallel movements, creating partnerships and helping to empower all of the eco-community projects to succeed and gain recognition as real-life solutions for the global transition we are in. The organizational process actually lasted all week, and now is in the hands of working groups who are organizing activities for the Peace Village to take place during the RIO+20 conference in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012.\\\\nThe Call of the Mountain is a meeting of the EcoVillages in Colombia that has been happening for 5 years, and this year the proposal was to expand the annual gathering to be a Consejo de Visiones, a Vision Council, continuing a tradition that has been building for over 20 years throughout Latin America.\\\\nThe event officially began January 7 and lasted through the 14, bringing together 478 people from 28 countries worldwide, a very diverse group: ecovillagers, environmentalists, indigenous groups, local communities, holistic therapists, spiritual seekers, etc... Diverse but united in seeking a just and sustainable world for all. Following the organizational structure of the Vision Council, there were 10 different Councils covering topics and cultural themes that together form the worldview and practices to build a better world. In this edition, the Councils were: Ecology, Health and Healing, Arts and Culture, Education, Youth, New Time (Council of the Noosphere), Spirituality and Traditions, Solidarity Economy, Networks and Social Movements, and the Council of Latin American Ecovillages.\\\\nEach day began with a choice of several Energetic Awakening activities: meditation, yoga, breathing, BioDanza, and so on. Those who wanted to sleep in joined the rest for breakfast between 8-9, and then everyone went to the Plenary, where important announcements were made, and then certain leaders and elders were invited to give conferences. From the plenary, we split up into the 10 councils, each organizing their own activities and workshops. After lunch there was some free time for personal activities and a barter market, and then from 3 to 6 more workshops and activities within the Councils.\\\\nBy late afternoon, we gathered in the great Maloka to practice Universal Dances of Peace, circular dances that incorporate sacred music from around the world. It was always a special moment to come together as a community and feel the power of our unity, singing and circling together, praying for peace in the world.\\\\nAfter dinner was la Noche Magica, (Magic Night) with artistic shows, open mic, and concerts in the Maloka.\\\\nThroughout the days we all shared everyday work of the Village, primarily by helping in the kitchen, cleaning and serving meals to the community. The teams were organized according to the color of a badge that each participant received upon entry to the gathering. A fundamental dynamic of these gatherings is that all participants work for the village and are a part of making it all happen.\\\\nThe Llamado was also simultaneously the Ibero-American EcoVillage Gathering, which meant the EcoVillage Council was really active with workshops and presentations from EcoVillages throughout the Americas and Europe, and of course a lot of cross-pollination and alliance-building.\\\\nAlso, much of the vision and structure of C.A.S.A. was further discussed and developed during brainstorms and meetings within the EcoVillage Council, solidifying the validity and importance of this new organizational proposal.\\\\nDuring the gathering, we had the opportunity to share some of the learning from our 20 month long (and counting) journey through Mexico and Central America, sharing ideas and stories collected from the projects we have visited so far.\\\\nAs part of the Ecology Council, we hosted a workshop on the construction of bike-machines, showing our 2 videos on the topic, and demonstrating Darlene and Burbuja, blending up a banana smoothie and even washing some clothes.\\\\nAt night we organized the Cinema Consejo, exhibiting some Com\\\\u00fan Tierra short films, and opening a space for other people and projects present at the gathering to exhibit their own work.\\\\nAnd of course, SEED EXCHANGE!\\\\nCom\\\\u00fan Tierra seed exchange and postcards during the barter market on the last day of the gathering.\\\\nColombia has a national EcoVillage Network, called RENACE, which has been organizing the annual Llamados and coordinates other functions of the national EcoVillage movement. Among other activities, RENACE organizes an alternative currency that works throughout Colombia\\\\u2019s EcoVillages, called La Monta\\\\u00f1a, The Mountain, which was used during the event\\\\u2019s barter market. During the final day of the meeting RENACE met to discuss the network, and decide how to organize next years meeting, the Call of the Mountain 2013.\\\\nThis Consejo de Visiones was very well organized and planned. With nearly 500 people, the event had tons of activities, always punctual, well communicated and well structured. The timing of meals, the plenary sessions, the activities were always on time, something not always easy in our Latino culture. The beautiful Maloka built for the event held space for the entire gathering with an energy of integration and spirituality. We know that organizing an event like this is a great challenge and a donation of time and energy, requiring a lot of work to manifest. That\\\\u2019s why we are so grateful to the team of organizers of RENACE and especially of the Atlantida EcoVillage who invested so much energy and infrastructure for the event, and the Atlantida EcoVillagers who offered their love and dedication to make this gathering possible. Through these examples, these labors of love, we are inspired to see it is possible to build together as a community, that we do have all the conditions to be the change we want in the world, and most importantly, we can do it with love and high-quality standards. Thank you familia!\\\\nMore than an event, the call was a real experience of connection and alliance between South, Central and North America building a world culture of peace and sustainability. We are grateful to be part of this link that is strengthening and growing each year, building and deepening relationships, sharing the stories of our cultures, as individuals, communities, villages, nations. The Llamado is a living laboratory of planetary consciousness where we are building the present and future that we dream of!\\\\nAnd so it was, a Vision Council, a place of relating, building, healing, communicating and forming agreements to work together. A portal in which we recognize ourselves as agents of transformation in the world.\\\\nWe leave inspired, filled with purpose, and guided by a vision of a world transformed into a planetary Eco-Village, an Eco-Planet, an Eco-World. So it will be!\\\\nWe write from Salento, where we are traveling in Caravan with a group of artists and friends, living as a small temporary community ... More adventures on the way!\\\\nFor more photos visit our Facebook group here.\\\\n\\\\u00a1Mil gracias por compartir con tanto detalle muy importante para los de nosotros que no pudieran asistir!\\\\nBeautiful!

              " '{\"text\": \"Welcome to some more Star Citizen today I wanted to talk about The Ship Pricing Problem & the pricing of ships in the game, short and long term.\\\\nTeach\\\\u2019s Shop \\\\u2013 in Levski on Delamar, was added to 3.3s PTU allowing for the purchase of ships with aUEC. A feature wanted since the game had a PU.\\\\nShops like this will have a selection of ships (but not all ships) based on the shop\\\\u2019s inventory.\\\\nYou interact with the ship to purchase it.\\\\nThere will be terminals in the future to allow you to buy ships from the kiosk UI.\\\\nInsurance wise \\\\u2013 Ships that you buy in game will stay with you until a reset & you\\\\u2019ll be able to insurance claim them like you would any other ship you owned.\\\\nThey are in the process of balancing the prices and mission rewards for 3.3 currently.\\\\nThe pricing of the ships has caused some some backers to claim the prices are unobtainable or unrealistic for the state of the PU in the Short Term. The game after all is reset often, at least once every 3 months when it comes to a LIVE build.\\\\nThe argument boiling down to, if they are adding this feature then the ships should be obtainable, and in a timely manner, so they can be played with by players before any resets.\\\\nThose prices are obtainable for some and not for others and with a few tweaks I think they could work a lot better.\\\\nIt is worth mentioning that at this stage Testing & Balance is a major factor when it come to ship prices in game in the short term. They want players to earn ships, then reset and have them earn them again to get metrics for missions rewards, progression, what prices these things should be at.\\\\nMissions, Cargo Hauling, Responding to Service Beacons (Escorts/Pickups), Mining, Scramble Races & to a small extent scavenging for cargo boxes while doing these other .\\\\nYour ability to do these gameplay loops will vary based on the ships you have.\\\\nIf you only have a starter ship like an Aurora or Mustang then really you can do minimal cargo runs, maybe pick up a person in an Aurora, Escorts or certain Missions.\\\\nMission Rewards have been criticised for being too low.\\\\nBut the more missions you do, the more rep you build up and you will get access to some more lucrative paying missions you can get.\\\\nStill grinding up to 1.6 million would be a significant time investment.\\\\nWhen making money via Cargo Hauling can be incredibly lucrative as you are able to leverage the amount of aUEC you have to just make more, as long as you are working out the trade routes.\\\\nSo how do you get from your starter ship to a ship that can make you more money from?\\\\nWell for me in Teach\\\\u2019s shop there is a missing link, something like an Avenger Titan, that has the ability to transport cargo but is also suitable for the myriad of other mission in the game.\\\\nSomething like that then allows you to much better leverage aUEC into making much more with Cargo Runs & get into some of the other missions like fetch quests & combat more easily.\\\\nWe are getting the ability to Rent ships in the PU, it\\\\u2019s not confirmed whether that will be in Teach\\\\u2019s in 3.3 or at all. It may be only certain shops have rentals. We also don\\\\u2019t know the relative price of this yet, length of rental, how this operates when the ship is lost/destroyed.\\\\nThis is also confirmed to have the ability to rent. The different selection of ships suggests to me, teach\\\\u2019s will have rental too. Again if that\\\\u2019s in 3.3 then that will be extremely useful as players can rent the Cutlass to do cargo runs, Prospector to mine OR just get access to these ships without such a long time to grind investment.\\\\nLonger Term Pricing \\\\u2013 Will be largely dynamic, prices of ships will be based on the materials, components, time, labour and technology needed to build them as well as the area they are in, supply and demand. Missions will be generated for NPCs and Players to bring materials to areas that need them for their economies, these materials are made into the ships and components for them. A shortage of materials will see prices rise for ships and items that need them.\\\\nLonger term there will also be a lot more missions, that will be scalable, opportunities to earn UEC by being part of a crew and working towards larger payouts.\\\\nI\\\\u2019m not sure if the prices of Ships should JUST be priced with the $$$ cost of the ship in mind.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s going to go the way of dynamic pricing eventually anyway, trying to balance prices and gameplay around the $$$ doesn\\\\u2019t seem smart when we have an extremely limited portion of the gameplay loops, jobs, roles, ships and things to do with money. I\\\\u2019m not saying completely ignore it, I am just saying there is more to that in the equation for the short term. The game needs to be PLAY to win rather than PAY to win.\\\\nThe reason to buy ships is to support the Star Citizen Project and get a bonus from that, ships change in price in $$$ and typically become more expensive as they go from concept to flyable BUT balancing gameplay & in game costs just around $$ for that is a bad idea imo.\\\\nA bit juxtaposed to this I\\\\u2019d say that they need to rework the UEC bought\\\\u2026 on accounts, the $1 = 1000 UEC at the moment, that needs to be reworked at some point, AT LEAST just before any final reset IMO \\\\u2013 However the short term benefit of UEC on you account does allow you to start with more aUEC every reset, you get any other starting amount PLUS the UEC on your account.\\\\nA potential solution or at least something to help mitigate inaccessibility to ships would to be to have every start with some more aUEC at least in the short term for 3.3 LIVE.\\\\nWhen will purchases and aUEC stick?\\\\nOnce they have Full Persistence (which is one of the pillars to release) there is no need for the to reset until they move onto using UEC, infact Full Persistence might see them use UEC (rather than aUEC) from the off, though they are likely to wait until they also have at least Server Meshing completed too.\\\\nThey will let us know what the plans for resets are as they move forward & when any \\\\u201cfinal\\\\u201d resets will happen too. Full Persistence may well be implemented towards the end of 2019.\\\\nReferrals \\\\u2013 Backers getting referrals can also get access to more ships via referrals.\\\\nSubscribers \\\\u2013 Get a ship of the month to use in the PU too.\\\\nThere are freefly events too that allow backers to have some extra ships in the PU for a limited time.\\\\nSo as long as there are some more steps between an Aurora and a Cutlass/Prospector, with something like an Avenger Titan being affordable without too much grind.\\\\nOR Rentals come online allowing players to access the ships.\\\\nOR They rebalance Mission Rewards / Ship Prices to make them obtainable.\\\\nOR They give players a larger chunk of aUEC to start them off in the PU at the moment.\\\\nPlease tell me your thoughts in the comments below, as obviously some of these are my solutions to ship prices and might not be the best. I\\\\u2019ll link the thread on Balance for Teach\\\\u2019s shop and ship prices too so you can get involved in that conversation if you wish.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"The bright light of Sunday morning shone on a new day in St. Louis. The heat and humidity have been persistent, but experienced mostly through the short walks back and forth between the America\\\\u2019s Dome Convention Center and the various hotels (in my case, it is right across the street). So, unless you took advantage of one of the tours, one\\\\u2019s exposure to the city of St. Louis was very limited.\\\\nYet, on Sunday morning, as has been the practice for the past few General Assemblies, commissioners, delegates, staff and observers join together with the congregations of the greater St. Louis area in their normal weekly Sunday worship service. While no doubt, the pews were a little more full, the singing a little more boisterous and the preaching a little more prepared, we were able to experience a little bit of the worship and mission of these congregations.\\\\nFor myself, I had chosen to attend the Third Presbyterian Church of St. Louis. Within this traditional African-American congregation, all of the GA guests were welcomed warmly as we were led in worship by their enthusiastic and talented music ministry (the same group who had sung at the opening reception). Challenging the congregation gathered from both the local neighborhoods and visitors from across the country, he proclaimed the Word of our grace-fueled neighborliness based upon the parable of the \\\\u201cGood Samaritan\\\\u201d in the Gospel of Luke.\\\\nOf course, we were treated to gracious hospitality afterward where we were privileged to join in fellowship and to hear more about the ministries of this congregation. This type of sharing together in worship reminds me so much of the unity that we have in Jesus Christ regardless of our differences in where we live, our worship practices, our cultural customs or our societal standing. If you have time, I would encourage you to read, see and hear about what God is doing at this congregation in which we were privileged to participate (thirdchurchstl.com). When commissioners returned to the plenary, there were opportunities to hear from each other about their various worship experiences that morning.\\\\nEarlier in the morning, I had participated in the breakfast for Mid-Council leaders sponsored by the Presbyterian Foundation. As one of the six agencies of the denomination, the Foundation continues its work of assisting individuals and congregations in investing funds in order to create a legacy of ministry over the years. Having personally witnessed the impact of funds invested with the Foundation, they serve as a valuable resource for ministry within our denomination. At this breakfast, we were treated to hear the singer-songwriter, Fernando Ortega. His music provided a great opportunity to begin this Sunday of worship after the long day of labor on Saturday.\\\\nIn mid-afternoon, the General Assembly returned to its work under the leadership of the new co-moderators, Vilmarie Cintron- and Rev. Cindy Kohlmann. Often, Sunday afternoon sessions appear to be less than important after the climactic moments of electing moderators and before the committees \\\\u201croll up their sleeves\\\\u201d and get to work. Yet, I find Sunday afternoon to be significant as we take time to commission new mission co-workers, hear important reports on the work of God throughout the world.\\\\nOn this Sunday afternoon, we heard from the Stated Clerk based upon the Matthew 6 theme and asking the question, \\\\u201cwhy did God bring us here for such a time as this?\\\\u201d The call to reform at every level results in transformation not just as an institution, but as a movement of Jesus Christ based upon collective faithfulness. His challenge was to focus not on success, but on significance.\\\\nThe 2020 Vision Team offered an Interim report from their work and presented a draft of the guidance statement. They encouraged members of the Assembly to reach out to them, to communicate, to listen and to comment not merely upon the statement, but the \\\\u201ccall\\\\u201d that it represents to all of us (Prayerful, Courageous, United, Serving, Alive). Thanks be to God.\\\\nA combined report from the Way Forward Commission and the All Agency Review Committee was offered based upon their charge to find a \\\\u201cway forward\\\\u201d for the structure and function of the General Assembly committees and to review and evaluate the various agencies in the denomination in fulfillment of the mission and directives. While they each issued separate written reports, they also offered some share recommendations. You may have hear that there is significant thinking (and disagreement) going into the ways that we structure some of the mission and financial operations of the legal corporation of the denomination. Some of these recommendations will be \\\\u201ctackled\\\\u201d by the Way Forward Committee as we move through the week. Regardless of the particulars of the conclusions, the expressed intention of greater collaboration and more nimble administration are desirable goals.

Often, this comes in the form of commissioner resolutions. In this General Assembly, Rev.

This resolution will be referred to one of the committees where it will be considered on its own or consolidated with other business already before the committee that they would consider to have overlap.\\\\nAs the day moves into the evening, all of the commissioners begin to gather in their committees for opening sessions that are open only to the committee members and leaders. During this time of preparation for their work, they begin to get to know each other, establish processes by which they will work with each other intensely over the next few days and consider the areas that will be addressed through overtures and their advocates. As for the rest of us (staff), we usually either try to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on other work or find something fun to do in the city because on Monday, the activity and engagement in real concerns will begin in earnest.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"What Are Some Symptoms That Indicate Your Car\\'s Differential Needs Repair?\\\\nCars that need differential repairs show symptoms of shaking, bumping and making hopping motions while driving. Differentials exist on all cars, and work to transfer energy from the engine to the wheels. They also provide stability while cornering; a suddenly unsteady, bouncy ride may indicate that it is time for a new differential.\\\\nVehicles with four-wheel drive have differentials in the front and rear while rear-wheel drive cars only have them in the back. Regardless of location, the symptoms of a failing differential are the same. In addition to excessive vibration, problematic differentials may cause a squeaking or grinding noise. When differentials do not work properly, car tires move at the same speed, which makes them unstable. They may start shaking or feel unsteady while cornering and maneuvering down straight roads.\\\\nAs with other car repairs, the type of driving surface, nature of driving purpose and frequency of driving impact the frequency of differential repair needs. High volumes of driving wear out differentials more quickly, as does driving on rough terrain, such as dirt roads.\\\\nTo keep differentials from causing trouble, drivers can have differential fluid levels checked during regular tune-ups. Mechanics can check to make sure fluid levels are sufficient to keep components and gears from wearing down. Like other car services, a differential repair requires an appointment with a mechanic.\"}\\n',\n",

However, the collaboration between the mother company of Android indicates that Samsung may get some breathing air from the deal as well in near future.\\\\nSuch feuds motivated Apple to fund patent troll companies like the Rockstar, whose sole purpose is to harass Android manufacturers in court. The decision from Apple to ceasefire came amid the ruling when it only won US$ 120 million damages against Samsung when it was seeking a US$ 2 billion payout.

Nowadays, there is a growing need for digital innovation that can bring a company closer to becoming a digital enterprise. And only new technologies have the power to enable companies to create more agile environment, become more flexible, scalable, while also delivering a seamless and consistent customer experience across channels.\\\\nBut while Digital Transformation can indeed help businesses achieve all that, for many, it may seem that this movement towards world run by technology and automation would make brands more distant from the consumers, instead of connecting with them more personally.\\\\nHowever, it is not true, and in fact, if implemented successfully, Digital Transformation is more than likely to help companies improve customer engagement.\\\\nRetail industry has taken a sharp turn. When we compare, what retail was about 10 or 15 years ago, and what it is now, the transformation is enormous. In fact, it makes us realise how fast the industry has changed with the help of innovative IT solutions, and the new technology.\\\\nTo understand it better, let\\\\u2019s look at the example: before, when someone had to make a purchase, they had a handful of options i.e. few local stores to choose from. And then, it was enough, but now the situation is quite different. Customers of digital age have a multitude of options to decide how and where to buy the product from. With an abundance of information available at the fingertips, customers have high demands and expectations from the retailer \\\\u2013 for example, nowadays, we don\\\\u2019t want to simply buy products in the store \\\\u2013 we want to get them delivered to our house, and we want it fast.\\\\nUsually described as resistant to change and quite conservative, financial sector has no choice but to follow other industries in their digital journey. Well-established, traditional banks have been challenged by financial technology start-up companies that take over industry by combining digital technology, social media, and big data analytics to replace traditional models with financial products and services enabled by new technology.\\\\nSo, as disruptive changes occurring in the financial services industry are largely the result of digital technologies that have been developed and refined over the past decade, it comes as no surprise that in order to survive, and stay competitive the financial services industry and its CIOs are increasingly embracing Digital Transformation to improve their IT infrastructures.\\\\nIn the age of Digital Transformation businesses must notice and respond to rapidly changing technology \\\\u2013 there\\\\u2019s no doubt about it. If they don\\\\u2019t, they are in great risk of losing their customers as well as their position in the market. Some companies do spot emerging technologies that can benefit their situation but they\\'d rather wait and see trying to avoid the risk of deploying new technologies into the business. Those companies, even though are aware of new technological trends, can\\\\u2019t, don\\\\u2019t want to or don\\\\u2019t know how to capitalise the opportunity. On the other hand, some businesses see the chance and take the action willing to take the risk.

In a meeting I attended recently, staff members were visibly excited as they attempted to introduce Common Core concepts to a group of parents.\\\\nCommon Core is an effort to create national standards for K-12 education. Sponsored by the National Governors Assn. and the Council of Chief State School Officers, Common Core has been adopted by 45 states since 2010. California plans to use the assessment system being developed by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, but has left it up to each district to figure out how to implement the standards.\\\\nAt its heart, Common Core is meant to achieve a few important goals: to tie what students learn to what they\\'ll need to succeed in college and the workplace; to improve analysis and critical thinking skills; and to create a national framework that allows for states to evaluate progress and share information.\\\\nBut all the excitement whipped up by the coming of Common Core must be tempered by some realistic expectations. Sorry to be a bit of a party-pooper, it\\'s just that a little perspective and caution is in order. We\\'ve seen so-called revolutions in education before that have resulted in mixed or controversial results \\\\u2014 remember the whole-language movement anyone? \\\\u2014 prompting a backlash toward more traditional teaching styles.\\\\nIndeed, a chorus of Common Core critics has emerged to take issue with many of the initiative\\'s features, including its focus on standardized testing. Most controversial is the greater emphasis on nonfiction reading, which many believe can be achieved only at the expense of exposing kids to important works of literature.\\\\nCommon Core enthusiasts consider these concerns overblown, and they may be right. But for all the promise of Common Core, the devil will be in the details, and in the implementation. The district is in the process of designing units of study to be piloted next year, and future staff training will focus on teaching the teachers how to employ the new methods.\\\\nIt was evident at the meeting I attended that going from the broad strokes of Common Core goals and strategies to actual classroom practices will take time, discipline and a teaching community that is fully on board with the changes.\\\\nIn one telling exchange between parents and district staff, questions about whether all teachers will cooperate and be held accountable under the new system were met with vague and somewhat confusing answers having to do with development, creativity and the impression that most teachers share their excitement about Common Core.\\\\nMany questions were also raised about how Common Core will affect existing programs, such as Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes, accelerated math tracks, and tests such as the California exit exam. Most of the answers were of the \\\\\"we need to figure it out\\\\\" variety.\\\\nAs puzzled as many parents seemed, the response to the basic ideas behind Common Core appeared positive. As they roll out the changes, it might help if district officials avoid educational jargon and acronym-heavy sentences. Speak to us in plain English.\\\\nAt one point during the presentation, a Power Point image was shown of a box split into four squares and references were made to \\\\\"quadrants A-D.\\\\\" I still have no idea what that was about.\\\\nObviously, Common Core\\'s success will require a lot more than just effectively communicating the concepts to parents. The real test will be in the classroom, and for that we need to give schools some time and flexibility to experiment, find out what works and what doesn\\'t, make adjustments, and continue to refine their methods.\\\\nIn Georgia last week news reports surfaced that 59% of students in a new math course tied to Common Core didn\\'t meet the standards in a final test. Does that mean that the whole plan should be scrapped? No, but it should be obvious that no overnight miracles are forthcoming.\\\\nAnother potential stumbling block also must be addressed before it becomes Common Core\\'s fatal flaw. So far, standardized testing will only be offered in English language arts and math. Although the hope is that teachers of history, science and other subjects will adopt Common Core methods, there\\'s no specific requirement that they do.\\\\nAnd given that they already have demanding curricula to get through, would biology teachers, for example, really want to take time out for students to read and analyze a government report on sustainable fishing?\\\\nObviously, many questions remain, and we can only hope that they are answered in a clear and practical fashion. Common Core might not be the revolution that some advocates are promising. But if all goes as planned, it could represent an evolutionary movement toward better teaching. Educators deserve a chance to try.\"}\\n',\n",

And these past two years the dreams I\\\\u2019ve had since I was a little girl about visiting Disney World have finally come true.\\\\nI had no idea what to expect at Disney. All I had ever heard was that it was amazing, but I had no idea what it actually looked like inside, what there was to do, or if it was worth the hefty admission price. Before I went to any of the other parks I knew I needed to visit Magic Kingdom, simply because that is traditional Disney at its best. I took a bajillion pictures both years I was there but I\\\\u2019ll try and summarize the best of my Disney trips in just a few pictures. There were incredible parades every few hours in Magic Kingdom with dancing and music. I loved them.\\\\nThere were really fun rides. I loved the Jungle Book ride down the river, my tour guide was hysterical. The Toy Story video game ride was so much fun, you have to try and rack up points throughout the ride by hitting targets. It\\\\u2019s A Small World was like a step back in time with the music and beautiful artwork. And Mickey\\\\u2019s Philharmonic was my absolute favorite thing to do in the park. Its a 3-D musical movie with a twist conducted by Mickey that re-invents all of the classical songs from Disney and lets you re-visit your favorite movies.\\\\nAll the Pirates of the Caribbean stuff was amazing. I was talking to my dad as I was walking through the park when I turned and saw this Johnny Depp look alike and almost screamed and dropped the phone. He looked so much like Johnny Depp!\\\\nVisiting Magic Kingdom was everything I imagined it to be. The park was immaculate, so beautiful, and filled with happy, pleasant staff. It\\\\u2019s the park I can\\\\u2019t wait to take my future family back to some day and to get to enjoy the magic with little ones!\\\\nThe other park I\\\\u2019ve visited is Epcot and it\\\\u2019s the park I think is perfect for 20-somethings as well as families. There\\\\u2019s so much to do, so much to see, and the entertainment and food are incredible!\\\\nWhen I was buying my ticket for the day the receptionist was so nice and recommended I check out Soarin\\\\u2019. She said it was the most popular ride in the park and that if I picked up a Fast Pass early in the morning I wouldn\\\\u2019t have to wait in a long line to get to ride it. Disney Fast Passes are awesome because they let you pick up a ticket early that guarantees you a spot in line later in the day. I took her advice and made a beeline for the pavilion Soarin\\\\u2019 is in. How stunning is this room? By picking up a Fast Pass I could go do other things for an hour and come back and only have a ten minute wait in line instead of a fifty minute wait in line. I\\\\u2019ll take it! The ride was incredible, it felt like you were really flying over some of the most beautiful sights in the world.\\\\nWhile I waited to use my Soarin\\\\u2019 Fast Pass I headed over to The Seas. Can you see the \\\\u201cMine\\\\u201d birds from Finding Nemo on the rock? I love them! This was such a cool ride that is also an aquarium. They have a restaurant attached to the building that I would love to try some time. While you dine you can see all the fishes swimming around!\\\\nAfter checking out the rest of the traditional rides at Epcot I went to go explore the World Showcase. I was BLOWN AWAY by how awesome this was. You walk through various countries that have different exhibits, shops, shows, rides, restaurants, and entertainment. The World Showcase is the reason why Epcot is my favorite park, I feel like I could come here over and over again and never get bored.\\\\nFor lunch I stopped at the Rose and Crown Pub in England because I heard the food was fantastic and they had a vegetarian shepherd\\\\u2019s pie on their menu. I\\\\u2019m Irish so I love shepherd\\\\u2019s pie but I haven\\\\u2019t gotten to enjoy it since becoming a vegetarian. Disney is awesome and has all their restaurant menus posted online. Since the first time I went to Epcot I ate meat I didn\\\\u2019t have a problem finding food anywhere, but this year being a vegetarian I wanted to make sure I found a meal I would enjoy. I looked over all the restaurant options for Epcot online and had my lunch and dinner choices picked out before I even landed in Florida for vacation. Type A, much? \\\\ud83d\\\\ude00 But I think it makes it a lot easier to plan out healthier meals with limited food options.\\\\nThe showcases were stunning! This is Canada. Their restaurant is supposed to be amazing too, I\\\\u2019d love to come back and try that sometime.\\\\nThe inside of the restaurant in Morocco. They had a belly dancer!\\\\nMe meeting Marie in France! She\\\\u2019s one of my favorite Disney ladies.\\\\nMexico. They had a mariachi band playing and even though you\\\\u2019re indoors it looks like you\\\\u2019re outside on a street at night with all the lanterns and candlelight and stars. Its really romantic, I would love to go back there with Josh.\\\\nAfter exploring the World Showcases I decided to visit the pier and hotel area next to Epcot. It looked like a New England seaport town, it was so beautiful.\\\\nThe New England-esque hotels were so pretty they looked like they were out of a picture book. Its a dream of mine to stay here when I have a family when we visit the parks. I absolutely love the atmosphere.\\\\nFor dinner I decided to check out Food Network Cat Cora\\\\u2019s restaurant, Kouzzina. I had heard fabulous things about this restaurant and they had a really delicious sounding vegetarian dinner option.\\\\nThe inside of the restaurant was beautiful, the service was incredible, and the food was to die for. I ordered the oven-roasted vegetables with oregano and kasseri cheese served with herbed orzo and loved every bite.\\\\nEach time I\\\\u2019ve been to Disney I\\\\u2019ve absolutely loved the experience and had the best time. If you are considering taking a Disney vacation I highly recommend it! It truly is one of the happiest places on Earth!\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019d like to read more about my journey going vegetarian, fun trips I\\\\u2019ve taken, or just random posts about my life feel free to check me out at Girl Gone Veggie. I love new readers! I also Tweet up a storm on Twitter.

It really doesn\\\\u2019t matter whether you do it in person or by phone. The information will come through just the same.\\\\n* Really think about and formulate your questions.

He was also the author and presenter of The Swarthmore Lecture at Yearly Meeting 2014, Open to Transformation .\\\\nDeborah Shaw is a recorded minister of North Carolina (Conservative) Yearly Meeting. She has travelled among Friends extensively, and visits Woodbrooke once or twice a year. She directs the Quaker Leadership Scholars\\' Programs (QLSP) at Guilford College, Greensboro, North Carolina. She explained that Conservative in this context means simply that the Meetings for Worship are unprogrammed, as are our Meetings in Britain.\\\\nThe evening was fully booked within a month of invitations being sent out in March. We were very sorry not to be able to accommodate all those Friends who wished to attend. As it was, due to several cancellations, a few Friends on the waiting list were only contacted the day before the event! In addition to our own Area Meeting, those attending came from the surrounding Area Meetings, even including members from as far afield as Sutton Coldfield, Oxford, Worcester, Cirencester, Hereford and Forest of Dean.\\\\nDuring the hour before the start of the meeting, Friends gathered in our recently acquired marquee where light refreshments were served. Groups sat around picnic tables in the garden and were also interested to see the displays in the children\\'s room, particularly the one depicting the history of Ettington Quakers. As 7 o\\'clock approached, those present moved without any prompting, into what more than one person described as \\\\u2018your atmospheric Meeting House\\\\u2019. In the time honoured manner of Friends, almost on cue, but without any, the expectant murmur of conversation diminished and fell into a deep silence.\\\\nIn their talk, Deborah and Ben shared how they had encountered the Divine in their lives, and how they have nurtured the sense of being in the presence to God. They drew from their experience and the Quaker tradition and suggested ways that the Meetings might do more to create a corporate intimacy with the Spirit.\\\\nThe talk was so vibrant and inspirational that we have found it impossible to write about it in its entirety - it needed to be experienced! However, we will try to share a few of the points that Ben and Deborah made.\\\\nWe heard how we need to live together communally; as Quakers, we are a highly individual Society, but we are not good enough alone - we need each other. Experience binds us together and we need that binding if we are to live the faith well. If we are fully present to each other, then we will be more fully present to God. We are not always good at sharing our experiences - Americans have a much more open assumption of faith, eg discussing it in the supermarket queue! Once more, Ben referred us to QFP: 19.08 in which Francis Howgill describes the sense of communion amongst the Westmorland Seekers in the 17th century.\\\\nDeborah suggested that we take the risk of having the faith to talk to God. She recounted her beautiful morning prayer which she says at the start of each day and reminded us that we can be present to God in body, mind and spirit at all times.\\\\nAfter about an hour\\'s talk, shared between Ben and Deborah, comprising song, prayer, humour, faith, and encouragement, we entered into a very deep silence, out of which, a number of spoken contributions were made by Friends present. After two hours of intensely spiritual experience, the meeting drew to a close and Friends made their way home.\\\\nJan and I found the meeting yesterday very deep and moving, and we enjoyed experiencing your atmospheric Meeting House in such a lovely setting.\\\\nIt\\'s amazing how settled we are as a group, even if we hardly know anyone else... The talk was inspirational and clearly had affected many others as well. I particularly valued the emphasis on Quaker Faith and practice from our origins as seekers of truth which I think sometimes gets lost in the effort to deal with the social ills of the day.\\\\nFor me, the presentation was unexpected and amazingly deep in its personal content of humour with anger, fear, forgiveness, prayer, love and commitment. This produced a gentle outpouring of the spirit from so many Friends.\\\\nI can\\'t thank you enough for making last night at Ettington possible. I am so happy to have been led there in such a magical and unimagined way. I was moved, challenged, inspired, humbled and many other things. However, perhaps above all, I was so strongly held and aware of the connectedness in that wonder of love and light that was a true gathering in the presence of the Divine.\\\\nWe have all experienced the unique atmosphere of Ettington\\'s beautiful old Meeting House that has been called the weight of worship . There was that and more at this wonderfully inspiring gathering of Friends, many of whom were strangers to one another at the beginning of the evening, but who felt deeply connected by the time we left for home.\"}\\n',\n",

Encoding and decoding secret messages is a key application of Computer Science called cryptography. An encoded message is called a cipher.\\\\nAs a wizard at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, Harry Potter often needs to decipher secret messages.

It would be easy for anyone to look at a cipher text and to be able to find a way to decipher it without being told how to in the first instance.\\\\nTo make this encryption technique more secure we will adapt the encode() function implemented in the trinket above. Instead of adding the string \\\\u201csss\\\\u201d after each character we will add three random letters.\\\\nBy completing this challenge, we are going to learn how to use ASCII code when manipulating strings.\\\\nYou will use the chr() and ord() python instructions to convert characters into ASCII code and vice versa.\\\\nprint(chr(97)) would display the letter \\\\u201ca\\\\u201d on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character \\\\u201ca\\\\u201d.\\\\nprint(ord(\\\\u201ca\\\\u201d)) would display the 97 on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character \\\\u201ca\\\\u201d.\\\\nUse this code to tweak the the encode() function. The decode() function should not need to be updated and should still work with this new encryption technique.\\\\nTest your code. Do you find the cipher text to be more secure?\\\\nUsing this encryption techniques the cipher message is based on the actual message with the letters of the message appearing in reverse order. e.g.\\\\nUsing this encryption technique, the same function can be used to both encode and decode a message.\\\\nYour task is to implement one function used to encode/decode a message, applying the \\\\u201cReversi formula\\\\u201d.\\\\nCreate two new functions to encode and decode two messages at the same time by intertwining each letter of these messages.

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the message to encrypt is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\\\\nYou will find out more about this technique by following this link.\\\\nCan you think of any other approach you could use to encrypt a message?

              " '{\"text\": \"I am a Bricklayer. What business structure should I choose?\\\\nIf you are considering starting a bricklaying business, it is critical that you choose a business structure that works best for your business. It can be a challenge choosing the right structure, as the future success of your business could well depend on the choice you make now. However, by having a thorough understanding of the financial and legal implications of each business structure, you can make an informed decision about which one is best for your business. After coming to some sort of decision about which structure will be best for your business, the advice of a legal professional will be invaluable. It will also provide you with a thorough understanding of how Australian business laws will affect the business structures you wish to choose.\\\\nIf you are looking to start your own bricklaying business, you might consider adopting a sole trader business structure. It is the most traditional of business structures and involves the owner becoming the sole trader. It gives you total control over your business, but also means that your personal finances and your business finances will be indistinguishable in the eyes of the law.\\\\nThere are many benefits of becoming a sole trader that range from financial to personal. Primarily, becoming a sole trader is by far and away the cheapest business structure to create, and if you choose to trade under your own name, you do not even need to register your business name. This means that you can enter the market as soon as possible, and gain valuable time in establishing your business and brand. Another advantage of choosing a sole trader structure for your bricklaying business is that your business will remain completely attached to you for its entire existence. So no matter how much your business grows and prospers, you will always be in complete control.\\\\nIt should be noted that there are also some disadvantages related to choosing a sole trader business structure for your bricklaying business. The main problem is the fact that your finances will all be rolled up into one. You may be personally liable for all financial decisions made in the course of running your business. As a result, you will be forced to wear two hats each time you make a decision, your business hat, and your personal hat. For some business owners this is not a problem in the slightest, for others, it is crippling. If this disadvantage is too much for you, perhaps you should consider a company business structure.\\\\nA company business structure will provide a sound basis for your bricklaying business to prosper and expand, without the fear of incurring personal financial liability. The primary benefit of a company business structure is that the finances of the business are separate from your personal finances. However, to allow for this financial protection, the costs of creating and running a company are higher than those of other business structures. You will also be subject to a vast array of statutory rules relating to how your company is run.\\\\nToday, the company business structure is the most attractive structure of all, primarily because of the financial protection it provides to business owners. However, in choosing whether you want your business to become a company, you must consider your aspirations. For a small business, the cost of running a company can be ruinous. However, for a large business looking to expand, the financial protection it provides can allow you to take calculated risks you might otherwise avoid.\\\\nTherefore, it can be said that all the advantages and disadvantages associated with each business structure are relative, as they depend entirely upon the situation of the business owner. If you would like to see a complete list of all the business structures available to your bricklaying business, please click here. Finally, it must be noted that you should seek the advice of a legal professional at some point during the process, as it will assist you in making the most informed decision possible. If you have any further questions relating to choosing the right business structure for your bricklaying business, please call LegalVision for a fixed-fee quote.\"}\\n',\n",

Getting the longest life out of your exterior paint can mean regular cleanings, repairs to wood siding, and touch ups to areas that are showing wear and tear. With a little TLC your paint job can last many years.\\\\nShould You Hire Out for Exterior Painting or Should You Do-It-Yourself?\\\\nIf you are a weekend warrior and feel up to the task then go for it, but if you feel like you don\\\\u2019t want to be on a ladder, or spend all of your free time painting, or have no idea how to paint then hiring a reputable, reliable, and experienced painting company is the best course of action.

Find out what surface prep they do. Ask about the quality of paint being used. Ask what the clean up procedure is at the end of every day. Ask what is included in the estimate \\\\u2013 is it labor or labor and materials? Request that they give you names of people in your area whom they have done work for so you can look at the quality yourself.\\\\nCall Jerry Enos Painting at 978-546-6843, or visit our website to find out more.\\\\nAs the calendar gets closer and closer to spring, many homeowners get into spring cleaning mode. For some this means cleaning out closets, while for others it means a full basement overhaul. While for still others it means touching up paint chips, scrapes, bubbles, and spots! If you are like me, and are one of these people who notices these little flaws around your house, then spring is a great time to do some much needed touch ups.\\\\nSpring allows for warmer weather, which means that paint can adhere and cure better and windows can be left open so that any residual smell can be erased by a good spring breeze. No matter if you are touching up in hallways, bedrooms, main living areas, or all of the trim throughout the house, here are a few spring cleaning touch up tips.\\\\nClean any area that you plan to touch up. It is no fun painting only to find a spider web or dirt and grime that has built up on the surface that you want to paint. Wipe down the area with a wet towel that is free of lint.\\\\nConfirm that you have the right paint colors. Hopefully you have extra paint in your garage or basement that is properly labelled. Make sure to mix it well and test the color first! Discard old paint and try to get a color match.\\\\nMake any necessary repairs that are needed to the surfaces you will be painting. Fill nail holes, smooth out surfaces, and sand raised portions of the walls. Do not paint over blemishes hoping the paint will hide a crack, bubble or peeling paint. This will just lead to a lack of adhesion and paint problems down the line.\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t forget to prime the area that you will be touching up. Primer is used to gain optimal paint adhesion and color blending.\\\\nAfter painting and allowing for proper drying time, check the wall to see if the touch up looks natural.\\\\nDo you need help with spring touch ups? Call Jerry Enos at 978-546-6843, or visit our website to find out more.\\\\nPainting is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to transform the entire mood and look of a room. Most realtors and interior designers alike advise homeowners of the benefits of painting the interior of their home including: cleaning and refreshing the surfaces, altering the look of a dated room, and adding value to a home without the large price tag. Once you have decided that painting is the way to go, how do you choose the color that is right for your home? Here are 4 steps to choosing the right interior color for your home.\\\\nGet Some Color Inspiration \\\\u2013 Look to items and colors around you that you are drawn to or make you happy. For example, there may be a piece of artwork, a swatch of fabric, a rug, or a keepsake that has a color in it that you love. Go from there and find a paint color that matches! If you can not find something in your surroundings that inspires you, look online for rooms that you would like to emulate. Jerry Enos Painting has several inspiration ideas online that can help you get started.\\\\nChoose Some Color Options \\\\u2013 Too many of us go nuts looking at swatch after swatch in the paint store. Choose several colors that you like and bring either the swatches or a small sample home with you. It is always best to apply a small bit to the walls in the room that you plan to paint. This way you can see how it would look in the light that is available \\\\u2013 unlike a store that may have dim lighting or, worse yet, fluorescent lighting.\\\\nChoose a Sheen \\\\u2013 Once you have decided on the color palette you would like to use, now it is time to consider sheen. The sheen of the paint can make a huge impact on how the color is seen. Glossy and semi-gloss reflect the light while matte and flat absorb the light. Be sure to take this into account when considering colors. Some people even test out the color they love in a few sheens to be sure they like the shine level. When choosing a sheen also consider what room is being painted. Rooms that get a lot of traffic and may have dirty or greasy hands touching the walls should go for higher gloss sheens as they are easier to clean.\\\\nThink Like a Designer \\\\u2013 Bring together all the textures, patterns, and colors that you hope to use in the room you will be painting to confirm that they coordinate well. Try out accent colors that will pop and coordinate with neutrals that you choose for furnishings or d\\\\u00e9cor. Most of all, have fun choosing your color!\\\\nIf you need help choosing a color for your interior rooms, call Jerry Enos at 978-546-6843, or visit our website to find out more.\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he anticipates an increase in the volume of investment in the current year.\\\\nasked the Chancellor of the Exchequer what has been the volume of investment for each year since May 1979 at constant prices.\\\\nI shall arrange for detailed figures for the volume of investment since May 1979 to be published in the Official Report. For 1982, the latest survey of investment intentions conducted by the Department of Industry suggested that there would be little change, compared with 1981, in the volume of investment in manufacturing industry, including leased assets. Investment in distribution and services should rise by some 4 per cent.\\\\nI am rather depressed by that news. Bearing in mind the heavy fall in investment in 1980 and 1981, does the Chancellor accept that there will have to be a massive surge of investment in manufacturing industry this year if we are to retain our manufacturing base? Given the Chancellor\\'s increasing tendency to live in cloud-cuckoo-land and to lose touch with economic reality, will he tell us how he expects British industry to survive in a highly competitive world when investment in our manufacturing industry is being cut, in contrast to that of our competitors, who have always invested more than us?\\\\nThe hon. Gentleman seems not to realise that the latest investment intentions survey shows a recovery of investment in manufacturing this year, probably sufficient fully to offset the decline in 1981. An even stronger growth should be seen in 1983. I venture to suggest that one of the reasons for the growing confidence of investors in Britain\\'s future is to be found in the declining prospects of the Labour Party.\\\\nIs not that information rather worrying? Is not the lack of confidence and investment in British manufacturing industry a conclusive indictment of the Government\\'s economic policy?\\\\nI have explained to the House that the facts are exactly the opposite of what the hon. Gentleman says. The prospective recovery of investment in manufacturing this year should fully offset the decline last year and is likely to increase next year. Moreover, distributive and service sectors can look forward to 12.5 per cent. additional investment in the first half of this year compared with last year. We are planning a substantial increase of 26 per cent. in investment in nationalised industries. I repeat that the main reason for the growing confidence of investors in the future of the economy is their growing certainty about the decline in the prospects of the Labour Party.\\\\n\\\\u00a7 of public resources in those nationalised industries whose inefficiency continues to be such an obstacle to our national economic recovery?\\\\nAs I have already told the House, we are planning a substantial increase of 26 per cent. in investment in nationalised:industries. My hon. Friend correctly underlines the importance of ensuring that that investment is well managed and fully used by those who work with it.\\\\nHas the Chancellor seen the statistics released a fortnight ago by his Government\\'s Department of Industry? Is he not aware that they show that in 1979\\\\u2014the year in which his party took office\\\\u2014investment in manufacturing industry was at its highest level for 10 years, and that in 1982, three years into the Government\\'s period of office, investment is expected to be at its lowest level for 10 yeas? Does that not more adequately summarise industry\\'s confidence in Government policies than any excuse that he can offer the House?\\\\nIf the hon. Gentleman had listened to what had said he would know that, for example, that in the first quarter of this year investment in manufacturing, distributive and service industries was up by 5 per cent. on last year. The decline has come to an end in manufacturing industry and there are prospects of an increase in investment in the year ahead. Moreover, investment in plan: and machinery in the first half of this year is up 8 per cent. on what it was in 1979.\\\\nIn view of the many schemes for public investment being pressed upon the Chancellor, will he give the House his opinion of the attempts by such bodies as the British Airports Authority and British Rail to attract private investment? Is he generally approving of such approaches, or is the Treasury concerned at the lack of control over the investment that may ensue?\\\\nMy hon. Friend makes an important point. The report that was prepared last year by the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee, and the two reports that were produced for the National Economic Development Council, drew attention to the scope for increasing private investment in nationalised industries, provided that the rewards of that investment are related to the risks undertaken and the success achieved, and provided that such investment does not cost more than it should. In that context it is important to be sure of the point made by my hon. Friend.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"What\\'s the Problem With Calling a Listing Agent to See a Listing?\\\\nIn states where agents are allowed to practice dual agency, when you ask a listing agent to show you their listing, the agent figures you are going to write the offer with them. It means the agent will receive the listing side of the commission and the buying side of the commission, meaning the agent gets both ends of the commission. That\\'s why it\\'s called double-ending.\\\\nIt is a sensitive issue for many buyer\\'s agents. The main problem is procuring cause. Proving procuring cause can be a long, complicated process, but agents who sue over procuring cause are typically the agents who first showed the home to the buyer.\\\\nIf you have signed an exclusive agreement to work with the listing agent under dual agency capacity, you may be obligated to purchase the home through that agent.\\\\n\\\\\"Are You Working With an Agent?\\\\\"\\\\nNo, we are not working with an agent at this time, but when we are ready to buy a home, we will find a buyer\\'s agent to represent us.\\\\nYes, we are working with an agent.\\\\nNo, we do not have an agent. Would you consider representing us?\\\\nAny other answer is likely to get you into hot water. Agents ask the question to establish an agency relationship. If you have an agent, the listing agent should back off.\\\\nThis is where it gets sticky. First, the listing agent will see your name on the purchase offer and will know who you are. It is not likely to sit well with the listing agent because the agent will feel as though they were used. Agents do not work for free.\\\\nYou might ask, \\\\\"Isn\\'t that the job\\\\u2014to show their listings?\\\\\" Yes, an agent is obligated to show client\\'s homes, but if you are working with another agent, typically your agent will show you the home.\\\\nTo compound the problem, let\\'s say there are two offers on a home.

              " '{\"text\": \"Originating in German soil, today Riesling is Germany\\\\u2019s numero uno grape variety, known for its characteristic \\\\u201ctransparency\\\\u201d in flavor and presentation of terroir (the idea of being able to \\\\u2018taste the place\\\\u2019), and its balance between fruit and mineral flavors. The emphasis is all about freshness on fruit and a balance between sweetness and acidity. The winemaking is very simple and straightforward emphasizing the flavors of the grape, and downplays the role (read as ego) of the winemaker. The best vineyards are on steep hill sides, the grapes are almost always hand-picked and hurried to the winery for processing with as little damage to the skins as possible: freshness of juice is seen as crucial. The great German Rieslings have exceptional intensity of fruit flavor deriving directly from the vineyard. Riesling wines from Germany cover a vast array of tastes from sweet to off-dry halbtrocken to dry trocken. Late harvest Rieslings can ripen to become very sweet dessert wines of the beerenauslese (BA) and trockenbeerenauslese (TBA) class - trockenbeerenauslese is expensive to buy and difficult to say. I think the unapproachability of these German words has scared away many an American wine drinker.\\\\nWinemakers in Alsace try their damndest to make a Riesling as different from that of Germany as the laws of chemistry and bio-chemistry will allow. Rather than thin, delicate little things, these are much richer and higher in alcohol. Rieslings produced in Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavors in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavors.\\\\nNow these are the wines that have inspired the Bright White Riesling of Municipal Winemakers. I learned how to love and how to make Rieslings in this style during my time in Oz. Here\\\\u2019s an interesting factoid. Germany has the most Riesling planted, more than 20,000 hectares or 50,000 acres of Riesling vines, more than 60 per cent of the world\\\\u2019s supply. But guess what? Australia is in second place, ahead of Alsace in France and Austria, both of which are famous for their Rieslings. Perhaps more important than the quantity of Australian Riesling, however, is its quality. With its predominantly dry, full-bodied, very direct and often rather citrus fruited style, and even the best examples are at around $15-$20 a bottle, I would argue it has won more modern wine drinkers over to Riesling than German Riesling. The German equivalent, in similar dry styles, is not widely exported and in fruitier, lighter form seems to be an acquired taste. On the face of it, one might imagine Australian vineyards were a bit too hot for Riesling (seeing how it comes from Germany). But this is the variety, imported by settlers escaping religious persecution in Silesia in the 19th century, that was the dominant Australian white wine grape until Chardonnay wrested that crown not much more than 15 years ago. Today, Riesling vines have been systematically replaced by Chardonnay in the country\\\\u2019s hotter, less suitable areas, such as the sweltering inland irrigated vineyards that supply the ocean of wine labeled South Eastern Australia and the sun-baked floor of the Barossa Valley, which tend to ripen Riesling too fast to develop any flavors of real interest. But at the same time Riesling vines have been planted in many of the country\\\\u2019s more recently developed, cool climate wine regions, which apparently constitute a surprising half of all designated wine appellations in Australia. Jeffery Grosset, perhaps the king of Riesling in Australia has made the move over to stelvin screwcaps. He has virtually single-handedly led first Clare Riesling makers and then more and more Australian winemakers into bottling both whites and reds under screwcap, so we can expect his Rieslings to last even longer to judge from early indications of how wines age under screwcap. If Clare Rieslings when young are steely, sometimes to the point of austerity, they develop a rather lime-like, very refreshing fruit quality with age and can eventually become quite toasty. Eden Valley Rieslings, can be rather more floral and overtly fruity but still with the dry finish that makes these wines so great with food, especially spicy, Asian-inspired salads and stir fries. Eden Valley are my personal fav Rieslings and can continue to develop in bottle for years.\\\\nFor winemakers in this country, the riesling renaissance has been under way for 30 years, but wine drinkers have become aware of it only during the last decade. Chardonnay, it seems, is a hard act to follow. Much of the renewed interest in the riesling grape has centered on German and Alsatian examples, but contrary to most expectations, Americans have begun to turn out fine versions of our own. There is some question as to who started the riesling renaissance, but there is little doubt what happened to the variety that made this comeback necessary. It was us Californians. We took a perfectly good grape and for a century made really bad wine with it. People forget now, but in its earliest days, the Northern California wine country had a Teutonic air to it. Winemakers with names like Dresel and Schram and Gundlach imported German grape varieties in the 1850\\'s and 60\\'s and made what they called riesling from them. Most were failures. The \\'\\'rieslings\\'\\' that survived were often blends of a touch of riesling and lots of sylvaner, folle blanche and other California-friendly varieties. By the 1950\\'s, California riesling was little more than jug wine, scorned by anyone who had tasted the real thing. Today, there are some good California rieslings -- by Smith-Madrone in the Napa Valley, by Navarro in Mendocino, and a handful of others. But the grape has never played an important role on the California wine scene. Riesling is a difficult grape to grow and, for a newcomer to wine, can be equally difficult to appreciate. It can be austere and steely, with breathtaking acidity to match its intense fruit. A good riesling hits you right away. Only in the sweeter versions, where the sugar masks the tartness, can it be considered user-friendly. For occasional drinkers, a great riesling can be a turnoff. For its committed fans, however, it is the finest grape in the world.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"If I say \\\\u201cD.O. Arribes\\\\u201c, what comes to mind? Most likely, very little, especially when considering that few Spaniards have even heard of this region. D.O Arribes is one of a handful of new D.O.s in the north central political region of Castilla y Leon, Spain, which has taken on a \\\\u201cquality wine region\\\\u201d status only in the last few years. And until I took a brief jaunt through this unbelievably beautiful wine region, did I actually give it the attention it so rightfully deserves.\\\\nIn total, there are 750 hectares of vines planted in D.O. Arribes, which spill across both the borders of Salamanca and Zamora provinces at altitudes between 150-700 meters. Here, the land defines itself by two very distinguishing factors: high flat ground and steep terraced land sweeping down into the majestic Duero and Tormes rivers. And interestingly enough, it was at the intersection of these two rivers where I had the opportunity to lay my hands on the powdery fine granite and quartz soils, inhaling the floral scent of blossoming almonds trees, in the 2,000 year old town of Formoselle, when I truly fell in the love with D.O. Arribes.\\\\nMaybe it was the small stone walls sweeping across the region like a maze, some of which housed the sheep famous for the region\\\\u2019s elegant and soft artisanal cheeses that caught my heart, or even the old gnarly vines stretching across the miles upon miles of stark, infertile land. But more than likely, it was the passionate and devoted farmers and winemakers who have worked this soil for ages, believing in its potential as quality winemaking region, which truly made an impression on me.\\\\nLike most of Castilla y Leon, D.O. Arribes has been known as a red wine producing area, championed by the indigenous grape to the medieval town of Fermoselle, Juan Garcia. Benefiting from smaller yields and modern winemaking practices, this grape generally produces young light reds that tend to take on a flavor profile truly unique onto themselves. Other principal red grapes include Rufete and Tempranillo \\\\u2013 also called, Tinto Madrid and Tinta Serrana, while Garnacha, Mencia, Bru\\\\u00f1al, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Bastardillo Chico are considered complementary grapes. Aging requirements for Crianza wines are 2 years with a minimum of 6 months in oak; Reserva wines are 2 years with a minimum of 1 year in oak; and Gran Reserva are 3 years with 2 years in oak.\\\\nRosados must be produced of at least 60% Tempranillo, Rufete and Juan Garcia grapes, with the remainder comprised of either white or red grapes authorized by the Denominacion de Origin.\\\\nAs for the whites of D.O. Arribes, they are absolutely worth your time. All wines must be produced with a minimum of 60% Malvasia, and may be blended with Verdejo, Albillo and Puesta en Cruz. For me, these wines tended to be fresh, crisp white wines with a lovely mineral and tropical fruit profile that provide the perfect accompaniment to the traditional foods of the region.\\\\nThis region also boasts of one of the largest protected parks in Europe called, Parque Natural Arribes del Duero, covering 191.255 hectares of land! And although I didn\\\\u2019t have the opportunity to explore this park, or every one of the 14 wine producers in the region, my curiosity has been sparked, and will hopefully inspire another trip in the near future!\"}\\n',\n",

Clan matches don\\\\u2019t necessarily take up more than two hours, in fact it\\\\u2019s more often than not, less than two hours long.\\\\nWrong again!

Also, small tanks are usually associated with lower costs.\\\\nLarge 200 gallon fish tanks can actually mean less time cleaning and changing water for it to function properly. This might sound counter intuitive but the truth is that small tanks are more difficult to change than larger ones.\\\\nYes, they are likely to be more expensive to install at the beginning and maintain. In the long term, however, maintenance costs are lower than for a smaller tank. The reason is that the filter systems are better and there are more technical features that keep the water clean, meaning fewer changes are necessary.\\\\nBottom line: the bigger the tank, the less maintenance is required because bigger tanks have more technical features that reduce the need for maintenance.\\\\nAlthough larger tanks can be easier to maintain over the long term, smaller ones are better for beginners. Fish tank sizes between 20 and 30 gallons can sometimes require more work to balance the water but easy to populate.\\\\nMy suggestion is always to start with at least a 30 gallon fish tank instead of a small fish bowl.\\\\nA 30 gallon fish tank means you can hold various species of beautiful fish that can not live in tiny bowls. This includes species like goldfish, sword tails, mollies, zebra danios and blue rams as they need a medium sized fish tank.\\\\nIf you want some shoals of fish, then you should consider a larger 200 gallon fish tank.\\\\nThe biggest difference between them both is that glass fish tanks are heavier than acrylic. However, they are also generally much cheaper.\\\\nFrom time to time leakages occur when using acrylic. This is normally and can usually be easily remedied with silicone sealant.\\\\nAnother thing to note about acrylic aquariums is that they come in different shapes, however, they scratch a lot easier.\\\\nAlso note that acrylic fish tanks are rarely filtered. This is because they consist of one piece without seams.\\\\nAlthough they are more expensive than glass aquariums, they last longer and scratches are superficial. Note that Scratches do not affect the way it functions \\\\u2013 just the way it appears.\\\\nYes, it\\\\u2019s true that you can buy acrylic tanks in a variety of shapes.\\\\nEverything from circle, cylindrical, hexagonal to the more traditional rectangle shapes.\\\\nThe traditional long rectangular shape is probably the best. I recommend a rectangle shape because of its large surface area. Especially when compared to the water volume. The result is that it allows the maximum gas exchange with the air.\\\\nOther shapes with smaller surfaces may need more maintenance and more frequent water changes. A rectangle fish tank is much easier to maintain. It allows you to contain more fish and it\\\\u2019s easier to maintain water quality.\\\\nOne of the best selling points of the SeaClear is its nearly invisible seams. It\\\\u2019s backed by the industry\\\\u2019s most comprehensive warranty. This makes it ideal for the most demanding aquarist.\\\\nCombination fish tank. This means the aquarium, the reflector and the electric lamp of 24\\\\u2033 are all included.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s acrylic which means that it\\\\u2019s lighter than glass tank alternatives.\\\\nAcrylic is 17 times stronger than glass yet nowhere as heavy as glass.\\\\nShockproof. This means that it\\\\u2019s less prone to flaking and tearing than glass is.\\\\nThe fact that it\\\\u2019s not glass means that it\\\\u2019s safer for children and pets.\\\\nWhen it comes to fish tanks, getting a 30 gallon fish tank is a great starter option. While there are many types of fish tanks available in different shapes, sizes and orientations, a long rectangular fish tank is the best of them all.\\\\nThere are several reasons why 30 gallon rectangular fish tanks are so popular.\\\\nThe first advantage is that long aquariums have a longer and bigger surface area. The larger surface area, the happier the fish are. This is also the space that is mainly used for decorating and adding filters.\\\\nTherefore, long aquariums can be decorated very well, as they offer more space for extra items you want to add.\\\\nAnother advantage of a long rectangular 30 gallon aquarium is that there is more room for fish. In smaller tanks, only certain fish can be housed, while you can safely put a variety of fish in a long tank.\\\\nJust remember that some fish grow very fast and you might want to buy a larger 200 gallon fish tank instead. This will save you the cost and hassle of future upgrades.\\\\nPrevious articleIs The Most Advanced Faucet Water Filter Really WORTH It?\"}\\n',\n",

They have good insurance so the house will be replaced and most of the contents, that is the good news.\\\\nHowever, they were sick when they found out the cause of the fire. The insurance investigator sifted through the ashes for several hours. He had the cause of the fire traced to the master bathroom. He asked her sister-in-law what she had plugged in the bathroom. She listed the normal things\\\\u2026curling iron, blow dryer. He kept saying to her, \\\\u2018No, this would be something that would disintegrate at high temperatures\\\\u2019.\\\\nThen her sister-in-law remembered she had a Glade Plug-In air freshener, in the bathroom. The investigator had one of those \\\\u2018Aha\\\\u2019 moments. He said that was the cause of the fire. He said he has seen more house fires started with the plug-in type room fresheners than anything else. He said the plastic they are made from is THIN. He also said that in every case there was nothing left to prove that it even existed. When the investigator looked in the wall plug, the two prongs left from the plug-in were still in there.\\\\nHer sister-in-law had one of the plug-ins that had a small night light built in it. She said she had noticed that the light would dim and then finally go out. She would walk in to the bathroom a few hours later, and the light would be back on again. The investigator said that the unit was getting too hot, and would dim and go out rather than just blow the light bulb. Once it cooled down it would come back on.\\\\nThat is a warning sign The investigator said he personally wouldn\\\\u2019t have any type of plug in fragrance device anywhere in his house.

Medicaid plays an incredibly important role in mental health access. The federal program is the largest provider of behavioral health (mental health and substance use treatment) coverage in the United States. In 2015, Medicaid covered 21% of all people with mental health needs, 26% of adults with serious mental illness, and 17% of adults who received substance use treatment. The Affordable Care Act helped make behavioral health services as widely covered by insurance as all other health services. However, only four Southern states have expanded Medicaid, keeping the affordability of mental health programs out of reach. Nearly 90 percent of all people left without health coverage are in the Southern states, due to the lack of Medicaid Expansion.

              " '{\"text\": \"Greeting cards businesses have not been rendered obsolete by emojis and e-cards. In fact, in an increasingly impersonal digital world, the meaning and value of each physically given greeting card have increased. For many would-be entrepreneurs, greeting card businesses have the benefit of being something you can start from your home for very little money. Here are a few tips on how to start a greeting card business using print folded cards.\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re running your own greeting card business, you need to find a niche that isn\\\\u2019t dominated by major chains. For example, you could create cards for occasions that are hard to find a card for in the store. Or you could market the product as supporting local artists. Another possibility is creating uniquely funny cards or groups that aren\\\\u2019t represented, whether it\\\\u2019s different religious denominations or greeting cards in less common languages.\\\\nOne issue you face is finding who will buy your cards. You can try to connect with small gift shops looking for inventory that distinguishes them from the mass market. Network with people who make gift baskets and would like to be able to order greeting cards that fit with the special occasions they support.\\\\nOne benefit of this approach is that you can find under-served vendors who would love to sell your product. Another benefit is the fact that you could drum up new customers, diversifying your customer base and protecting you against failure if one customer closes shop.\\\\nA second strategy is finding companies that would buy the products you want to produce. One benefit of this is that you could get your business going once you secure your first major customer. The downside is that if you rely on just one or two big customers, their decision to shift product mix could affect your business.\\\\nA third strategy is trying to sell your cards online. This allows you to sell products directly to your customers. This could be gratifying, and it may let your business grow via word of mouth referrals once a few people are happy. It could allow you to sell cards for specific occasions that there isn\\\\u2019t a major market for. The downside is that it requires you to increase your prices to cover the price of the product, shipping, and handling. In some cases, you could secure lower overall prices by arranging print folded cards online, where others order your designs printed by a third party and they are shipped to the customer. This eliminates your need for inventory.\\\\nOne option is buying greeting cards from wholesalers and printers. Another option is using your own artwork and having custom folded cards printed through websites like print24; now you own the intellectual property rights to the artwork and can profit from it. Or, you could sign a licensing agreement to use the designs of your friends, and then you can pay for cheap folded cards decorated with their designs. If you\\\\u2019re working with a printer that accepts orders online before sending you the profits (after their costs), you\\\\u2019ll need to finalise your business arrangement before you say you\\\\u2019re in business. If you\\\\u2019re going to hand-make cards, you need to make them before you can sell them.\\\\nOnce you have some inventory, you\\\\u2019re ready to start selling. We suggest having an inventory before you start selling because you cannot afford to have people place orders for something they need as soon as possible when you don\\\\u2019t have it on hand. If you allow custom orders, advertise that on your website, business card, and social media profile. If you already have a few customers lined up, you can count the products as sold when your customers have paid you for them.\\\\nSuppose you\\\\u2019ve successfully sold a large part of your initial production run. Run the numbers across all of your product designs. The most popular designs could be ordered in larger quantities from a folded card printing shop while you can delay making more of the items you still have in stock. The benefit of this approach is that you don\\\\u2019t end up sinking money into inventory that doesn\\\\u2019t sell, much less the hassle of selling it at a discount and potentially undermining your brand.\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re making the cards at home, you can now plan on ordering cardstock, ink and other supplies based on your demonstrated \\\\u201cburn\\\\u201d rate or the speed at which you\\\\u2019re going through those items.\\\\nIf you want your greeting card business to be successful, first identify your chosen niche and then pick a business plan to profit from it. Start making an inventory or secure the business contracts to have the stock made. Only then can you start selling and build a solid customer base.\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"Can I be real with you guys for a minute? This week has been a tough one for me emotionally. As many of you know, my kids have food allergies. N is allergic to all nuts as well as sesame. E is allergic to nuts. The allergies are severe, meaning if they take a single bite of something that they\\\\u2019re allergic to, they could die without immediate treatment. Even with the use of the EpiPen, it\\\\u2019s still a very dangerous situation.\\\\nFood allergies are real, people. They\\\\u2019re not made up. They\\\\u2019re not something exaggerated or fake. We first found out about N\\\\u2019s allergy when he was 18 months old, had one drop of tahini and spit it out. It never even entered his stomach and his face still swelled up so much he was almost unrecognizable. It was hands-down the scariest and worst day of my life and it was also a life-changing moment for our family. Finding out about E\\\\u2019s allergies was slightly less dramatic, but they\\\\u2019re just as serious.\\\\nThis week I heard about the anaphylaxis scene in the new Peter Rabbit movie. I haven\\\\u2019t seen it, but I\\\\u2019ve heard about it in detail. I know we live in a day and age where everything insults or offends someone and we\\\\u2019re all overly PC. However, making light of a food allergy is dangerous.\\\\nIf you know someone is severely allergic to a certain food (in the Peter Rabbit example, blackberries), and you purposely try to get that person to ingest what they\\\\u2019re allergic to? That\\\\u2019s nothing short of attempted manslaughter in my opinion, and that\\\\u2019s not something I want in movies my young children are viewing.\\\\nThere was definitely a moment at the dinner table where I was sobbing and telling the kids how much I love them and how careful we have to be. SOBBING. It was really attractive and I\\\\u2019m 99% sure the kids thought I had lost my mind.\\\\nOther than that, things are really okay. I know there\\\\u2019s probably a lot of you out there dealing with way worse than what I\\\\u2019m going through this week, but it was just really emotionally draining and I feel exhausted. I\\\\u2019ve also been getting up at 4:10 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays to work out \\\\u2014 days which happened to be Ben\\\\u2019s late nights this week, so that could have something to do with that exhausted feeling.\\\\nSpeaking of exhaustion, I\\\\u2019m typing this on Wednesday and I thought I was going blind this morning. I woke up (4:10!), started the coffee and the oil diffuser and then went back to the bathroom. I put my glasses on and my eyes felt super dry and I couldn\\\\u2019t focus or see clearly no matter what I did. I rubbed my eyes, blinked hard, but still, everything was a big blur.\\\\nThen I realized. I wasn\\\\u2019t going blind. I forgot to take my contacts out last night. The dryness? From having my contacts in while I slept. The blurriness? From doubling up on my prescription when I put on my glasses. I think I\\\\u2019m in need of a vacation. Anyone with me?\\\\nI feel like I should type something happy after \\\\u201cmy kids could have died\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cI thought I was going blind,\\\\u201d but this is already getting long and I haven\\\\u2019t even started throwing links your way! I\\\\u2019ll just say this: I\\\\u2019m incredibly grateful for EpiPens, good friends, and glasses. And even 4:10am workouts, because they make me feel amazing.\\\\nContemplating: These weights for our gym. Anyone have experience with them? I already have sets of 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 20 pounds. They\\\\u2019re currently taking over my living room \\\\u2013 can\\\\u2019t wait for our basement gym to be completed! I\\\\u2019m tossing around purchasing a set of 25 pound weights but the adjustable ones are definitely the less expensive way to go in the long run. Because Ben will be using these weights as well, we need weights in 5 pound increments all the way up to 55+ pounds. At about one dollar per pound, it adds up when you\\\\u2019re buying two of each. If you have experience with the adjustable weights, I\\\\u2019d love to hear it!\\\\nNew to me: I also jumped on the essential oils bandwagon recently, and I gotta say I\\\\u2019m kinda loving them. Anyone have any experiences with them or any favorite combinations?\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t know where yet: But I\\\\u2019m going to find a spot for this in my house \\\\u2013 I love it! I also love this\\\\u2026.just need to find an excuse to buy it.\\\\nNew on Rachel Cooks: Lots of great stuff for Valentine\\\\u2019s Day\\\\u2026.oh wait. But seriously, a no-bake chocolate tart that is made with only four ingredients is good anytime of the year.\\\\nInstant Pot Chili \\\\u2013 This recipe is Whole30 compliant and also Paleo, buuuuut it\\\\u2019s amazing for anyone. I also dive in deep with tons of different ways you can adapt it, including making it on the stove or in your slow cooker.\\\\nTHE chocolate tart. This is a must-make, you guys! Perfect for entertaining because it looks so fancy but it\\\\u2019s ridiculously easy.\\\\nWhole 30 Sausage \\\\u2013 Again, Whole30 but SO delicious. I\\\\u2019m going to make these pork and apple sausages year-round.\\\\nCaesar Croutons \\\\u2013 Because once you go homemade croutons, you don\\\\u2019t go back.\\\\nLemon Salmon with Dill \\\\u2013 This is my go-to salmon recipe. Ben loves it and it\\\\u2019s healthy and easy to make!\\\\nComment that\\\\u2019s making me smile: Keep leaving those comments! My favorite part of sharing recipes with you is hearing about your experiences with making the recipes! Hillary made my roasted broccoli and said, \\\\u201cAside from the benefits of roasted broccoli tasting so DELISH, it also doesn\\\\u2019t make my house stink like steamed broccoli does! It\\\\u2019s like eating broccoli chips. YUM. Thanks for the recipe. I added some marble cheese 5 minutes before they were done.\\\\u201d Thanks Hillary, so glad you liked it! I\\\\u2019m going to try adding cheese next time!\\\\nBlackberry Coconut Crisp from Barefeet in the Kitchen. Fruit crisps are my favorite desserts and I\\\\u2019m totally into the idea of adding coconut.\\\\nMelting Sweet Potato Salad from Foodie With Family. This one looks perfect for when you feel like you should eat a salad but you don\\\\u2019t want to feel like a rabbit. This is one satisfying looking salad!\\\\nProsciutto Wrapped Chicken with Asparagus from The Food Charlatan \\\\u2014 perfection!\\\\nMediterranean Bulgur Salad from Recipe Runner. 100% my kind of salad \\\\u2013 yours too?\\\\nBourbon Maple Golden Acorn Squash Pie from Country Cleaver. I have no words\\\\u2026can someone come make this for me?\\\\nFor the kids: I want to buy this darling vest for E (such a great sale!) and this old man sweater for N.\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s all I have for today! Thinking up some recipes for the next couple of months \\\\u2014 send me any requests you have!\\\\nI am new to your site, but enjoying the recipes and the everyday life story extras already. I came on to print off your acorn squash recipe.\\\\nThanks for telling me more about yourself! We did buy some adjustable weights \\\\u2013 I use them when I like greater than 25 pounds (just like you!). I find it awkward to hold two, but I like to do one heavier one with a kettlebell handle.\\\\nThanking God that your children are fine now.\\\\nSo scary! I would have been like you.\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"One thing I can always expect in my personal adventures as a patient navigating the Healthcare System is a good dose of introspection, namely because I have to answer the same questions over and over again. After a back injury, I had to make the all the usual rounds, starting with multiple visits to my primary care physician, followed by trips to an orthopedic, a surgeon, two visits to separate MRI facilities, and a stop at a walk-in clinic to get an EEG before being cleared for surgery. The entire experience, which I\\\\u2019ve had too many times before, might be compared to touring a job fair \\\\u2013 except that this one takes place over many weeks and places, almost always with a lengthy wait in-between.\\\\nThis need to constantly repeat the same sort of information over and over again in different ways is pretty frustrating as a patient, and maybe even more so as a clinical researcher. I can\\\\u2019t begin to estimate the number of Medical History CRFs I\\\\u2019ve seen over the years, but I can sure recall how different they all were. In many cases, most of the data collected was too messy to use for any serious statistical analysis, and the possibility of pooling this data across studies (even for a single sponsor) is dubious. The questions are worded in many different ways, usually not coded to any standard vocabulary, and, for all practical purposes, not much more useful than unstructured text. In fact, it seems my providers mostly just these as images, where they can be safely tucked away until I\\\\u2019m asked to fill another form again from time to time.\\\\nAs a long-time believer in data standards, I\\\\u2019m flummoxed to explain why we\\\\u2019re not all using standard medical history forms. Sure, the questions may vary depending on what type of specialty is practiced by each provider, or which therapeutic area is being explored for each study, but is that really an excuse for making each unique to each institution? Surely it must be possible to define a General Medical History form, which can be made publicly available, perhaps through Meaningful Use, that covers the most common conditions of interest. And then additional standard modules can be created that can be tacked on by specialty or therapeutic area. These will always ask the questions in the same way, and can code conditions to standard terminologies, including both SNOMED CT and MedDRA for research studies, and maybe even including ICD-9/10 as well. Coding might make it possible to actually make use of this data, when looking to identify patient populations in epidemiological studies, assess protocol feasibility, or even identify potential research subjects. What\\\\u2019s more, as a patient, if I was given a copy of this competed form, perhaps as a CCD document in XML format, maybe I could carry it with me (or store it in the cloud) as part of my Personal Health Record so I don\\\\u2019t have to keep filling out more forms with the same damned data over and over again. Seriously.\\\\nSo, hello, why can\\\\u2019t we take this one small step for patient, subject and researcher-kind?\\\\nMeanwhile, if you think that\\\\u2019s not frustrating enough, let me tell you about what I have to do about my meds each time. But let\\\\u2019s save that for Part 2.\\\\nNext Post A Modest Proposal Part II \\\\u2013 What Meds Are You Taking?\"}\\n',\n",

As it happens, everything works out for the servant, and he find exactly who he\\\\u2019s looking for in Rebekah, and he makes his way back to bring her to Isaac.\\\\nAn interesting thing about this chapter that I didn\\\\u2019t get into in the recording is that it is also in a way talking about the church being the bride of Christ. Just as Isaac is the son of the promise made to Abraham, Jesus is the son of God promised to the world to take away sin. Just as Rebekah is pure and chaste, the church is purified by the blood of Christ and cleansed from sin.

It might be that you\\\\u2019re tired of the expense and time spent driving back and forth \\\\u2013 or it might be that you want an extra vehicle for all your visiting family and friends.\\\\nWhatever the reason, you may decide to leave one of your cars at your U.S. home year-round, in which case you will have to take the following steps in order to be compliant with U.S. law.\\\\nRemember, you can only have your Canadian licensed car in the U.S. for up to one year at a time without importing it permanently. If you keep your car in the U.S. for more than a year, it can be seized for non-payment of duty, so if you do decide to keep your car there permanently, it\\\\u2019s important to complete the import process before the 365 days are up.\\\\nBefore you decide to import your car to the U.S. from Canada, we suggest you read these import requirements and this overview on importing a vehicle to the U.S. from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Depending on your situation, exporting your car can be a confusing, time consuming and sometimes impossible process, so it\\\\u2019s not for everyone.\\\\nIf you intend to keep your car in the U.S. beyond a year and convert it to a U.S. registration, be sure to declare this to the customs officer at the border when you cross into the United States.\\\\nYou\\\\u2019ll need to provide the officer with your vehicle registration as well as completed DOT Form H7 and EPA Form 3520-1 and any supplemental documentation to prove that your car meets safety and emissions standards (see Step 1 below).\\\\nIf everything is in order, you will receive written approval that you have met all the requirements from the customs officer, which you must then take with you to your final destination where you will register your car and convert it to a U.S. registration and ownership.\\\\nMake sure to ask the customs officer to stamp your passport at the border so you can prove when you entered the U.S., as this may be helpful later on in the process when you register your vehicle.\\\\nAutomobiles are generally subject to duty of 2.5% of their current value when they are imported to the United States. However, vehicles manufactured in NAFTA countries (Canada, U.S. and Mexico) are usually exempt from this duty.\\\\nPlease note that while this article provides helpful information on the steps needed to import your car to the U.S. from Canada, regulations can change without notice and you should always consult the relevant agencies for complete guidelines and up to date information. In addition, keep in mind that some procedures may differ depending on which State you reside in, so you may want to check State requirements as well.\\\\nAll vehicles less than 25 years old must meet all U.S. FMVSS standards to be imported into the United States. You can determine if your vehicle is compliant by looking for a FMVSS certificate label (usually inside the car door or under the hood). If your vehicle has this label, you should have no problem importing it to the U.S. from a safety standards standpoint.\\\\nHowever, in many cases you will find that your vehicle only has a label certifying it complies with all Canadian motor vehicle safety standards (CMVSS). If you have foreign car, it may not have a safety certificate label for Canada or the U.S.\\\\nIf your vehicle is only certified to meet CMVSS standards, you can still import your vehicle to the United States as long as you get a letter from the vehicle\\\\u2019s original manufacturer (not dealer) on the manufacturer\\\\u2019s letterhead stating that your vehicle conforms to all applicable FMVSS standards - you can find a list of manufacturer contacts here. It\\\\u2019s important to note that some car manufacturers are refusing to issue such a letter, so make sure you check with them before doing anything else.\\\\nIf your car isn\\\\u2019t certified to meet FMVSS or CMVSS standards, you will want to look at the regulations to explore your other options.\\\\nHowever, you\\\\u2019ll probably find that it just isn\\\\u2019t worth the time, expense and hassle in this case, as you\\\\u2019ll generally be required to engage a Registered Importer to import your car into the United States and make the necessary modifications (you can find a list of Registered Importers here) and post a bond for 1.5 X the current dutiable value of your car until it is modified and certified.\\\\nFor complete DOT safety standard guidelines and procedures related to importing a vehicle from Canada to the United States, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.\\\\nAll vehicles that are imported to the U.S. must conform to the EPA\\\\u2019s emission standards requirements.\\\\nIf your vehicle has a label stating that it is certified to United States EPA federal emission standards, then you shouldn\\\\u2019t have an issue importing your vehicle. To see if your vehicle has been certified, look under the hood of your car or in the engine compartment for a label that reads \\\\u201cVehicle Emission Control Information\\\\u201d and includes the certification.\\\\nMore often than not, your Canadian vehicle won\\\\u2019t have a label indicating it is EPA certified. However, in many cases your car will have an emission control system that is identical to an emission control system that has been certified in the United States.\\\\nIn both situations you can still import your vehicle to the U.S., but you will need to obtain a letter of compliance from the vehicle manufacturer\\\\u2019s U.S. representative stating that the vehicle complies with all U.S. EPA regulations. You can find a list of U.S. Auto Manufacturer\\\\u2019s Representatives here. Note that some manufacturers may refuse to issue a letter.\\\\nIf your vehicle does not have an EPA certification label and does not have an emission control system that is identical to one certified by the EPA, you will want to look at the regulations to explore your other options, as you may be eligible to apply for a written letter of exemption from the EPA which must be obtained prior to importing your vehicle.\\\\nOutside of an exemption, you\\\\u2019ll likely have to use an Independent Commercial Importer to bring your vehicle south of the border and modify it, as well as post a bond. Once again, if you find yourself in this situation you\\\\u2019ll probably find that it just isn\\\\u2019t worth all the added time, expense and hassle to export your car from Canada to the U.S.\\\\nComplete emission standard requirements and guidelines for importing a car to the U.S. can be found on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website.\\\\nThe rules keep changing regarding Canadians who have residences in the U.S. as to whether they need \\\\u2013 or indeed are even entitled to obtain \\\\u2013 a U.S. driver\\\\u2019s license or I.D. card. You should check with your State of residence what the rules are-- and whether you can just use your Canadian driving license on an ongoing basis.\\\\nIf you do need to apply for a license and/or I.D. card, you will have to provide your Canadian driver\\\\u2019s license, your passport for a second photo I.D. and a property tax bill or other utility bill with your name and U.S. address on it. There will be a fee and you will have to renew it each year. Also they may take a photo of you and an eye scan. It is possible that they may require proof of the day you entered the U.S. to ensure you have not gone over the allowable time (180 days). If your passport was stamped when you entered, it is helpful.\\\\nYou must arrange for U.S. auto insurance before your car is transferred to a U.S. registration, as you cannot keep your Canadian insurance once you do this.\\\\nAccordingly, you will need to find a U.S. auto insurance broker or company. They will require your Canadian ownership details and a copy of your driver record in Canada. Shop around as the market is quite competitive for U.S. auto insurance. Be sure to mention if the car will not be driven for 6 months of the year.\\\\nYour car will be inspected in order to get a new registration and ownership. Check locally to see where your nearest car registration office is and make an appointment. You must bring all your paperwork that was approved at the border. They will verify your serial number and your odometer reading.\\\\nMake sure that you are at a location that is authorized to verify vehicles for aliens. (that\\\\u2019s you!) You will have to pay a one-time fee for the first time you are issued your new plates.\\\\nIf all of the above sounds like a lot of running around (and it is!) then you might want to consider purchasing a new or used vehicle in the U.S. instead to avoid some of steps and potential issues outlined above.\"}\\n',\n",

For example, airlines can use historical data around demand for a particular route to adjust flight capacity and price in order to maximize benefits.\\\\nTechnical skills and a love for data are important, but not enough.

The next step after using data to obtain information is to turn that information into visuals to make messages clearer and more memorable.\\\\nVisualization is a good way to communicate findings, but data scientists use an additional tool: stories.

Further, there are plenty of family-fun activities through the recreational department, school systems, privately-owned businesses, natural trails and exhibits. Dalton State College offers degrees in Business, Communication, Psychology, Education and Political Science. Dalton has been credited as one of the few places in the country where business and education combine to enhance long-term learning.

It\\'s one of few pieces of architecture in the state that pre-dates the American Civil War.\\\\nThe trains also transported soldiers during the Civil War and contributed to the city\\'s economic growth and transportation of goods.

              " '{\"text\": \"Chances are good that I\\'ll post another version at some point to play with a couple other ideas, but it\\'s done. I give you my track machine DeTomaso Pantera! Was lots of fun and I got a chance to play with carbon fiber. It you look at the front and rear spoiler you\\'ll see what I mean. It turned out looking pretty cool I think. I\\'m also posting an Audi R8 done by my brother just a little while back as well. He put a bunch of little custom tweaks into it and the colors are just perfect. Even the most anti-two-tone enthusiast can dig on this color scheme ... to me, it just works.\\\\nI\\'ve been taking my sweet time with this project and you can see more updates than this at lateral-g.net but it is progressing along at this point. Here is a http://www.lateral-g.net/forums/showthread.php4?p=347942#post347942 to the actual thread. The body is pretty well complete, now I\\'ll be putting in the stuff that gives it the race car vibe. I\\'ve gone back and forth over the rear spoiler but I feel that given the car\\'s theme, it will need a race wing.\\\\nWell if you direct your browser to lateral-g.net and go for the artwork section in the forums, you\\'ll find my little community project. It\\'s a trial run, first time. It has come together pretty well and I\\'ve got a list of things I\\'ll do differently next time around. It started with the first ten cars that people suggested - they went into a poll with a few styles and colors and everyone started voting. I set the poll to expire in 30 days so you\\'ve got unit May 1 2011 to get your vote in. The real question is, why vote? The poll results are public, everyone who votes, goes into a hat and a name will be drawn. That person gets to put the finishing touches on the car. See the deal is, the poll can only handle 18 options which isn\\'t many when you figure all the things that can be done to a car. However, the winner will be choosing wheels and helping me figure out just how to modify the car\\'s looks. Then when it\\'s drawn, that person will receive a signed print of the rendering. Those prints will then go on sale right here at the O\\'Dell Studios blog in the Prints tab.\\\\nFor anyone interested, a 70s De Tomaso Pantera is currently in the lead to be rendered as a purpose built track monster which is going to be great fun. I\\'ve got visions of fender flares, turn buckle-adjustable front splitters, sponsor decals, roll cages, the works. But I\\'ve also got visions of body mods. The car\\'s shape lends itself to modification well and there are a few things (like pop-up head lights) that could use updates to bring the car into the 21st century. BUT! There are a couple other cars creeping up and tied for 2nd at this point, and the Pantera may not be on top in the end.\\\\nGot some leftovers from the show and they are now available. We\\'ve got a couple versions; the signed and numbered prints are 13x19 high end units. $35 a piece or the set of both cars for $60. The second variety are your average toner-based prints on 11x17, unsigned, for $10. Send me an e-mail at colter_odell@odellstudios.com and I\\'ll get you fixed up.\\\\nLike any project it gets to the point where looking at it just won\\'t help. A couple more ideas out.\\\\nI think I\\'m just about gonna call it done. I\\'ll have to have a proof printed and make sure it looks the way I think it should, but aside from that, not much else to do here unless I see something I hate about it between now and the weekend.\\\\nJust wanted to also throw up the sketch of Sasquatch. Nothing amazing, just a quick 20 minute job after doing a few doodles of people in suits with their arms crossed.\\\\nNearer to completion. The Emerald City Comicon itself draws nearer too so the clock is ticking. But I think I\\'m getting there on my piece. It\\'s actually kinda tough not to leave it a cool bit of automotive art but it felt like more was needed. My Sasquatch sketch (I\\'ll have to post the sketch) turned out pretty good and the final colored version ended up the way I meant for it to so I felt like it deserved to be included. About all I wanted to accomplish was to make him look like he would be found in a comic book. I didn\\'t want him over-rendered and I think it came out just right.\\\\nOK so he\\'s gotten pretty far along before I got a post up but this is AJ\\'s portion coming together. Still a WIP but we\\'ve got a mild custom Camaro going on in the same hue I used. Getting away from the green overtones but with an obvious Seattle icon for part of the background. We\\'ve kept the mods mild on both of these modern muscle cars to maintain recognition but subtle improvements make them even more appealing than they already are.\\\\nI still want to try a couple different things with the light streaks but this is my initial layout. Next I\\'m working on my Sasquatch!\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"What is the maximum speed of a NANO motor?\\\\nThe legal maximum is 15.5mph On a NANO Brompton you can effortlessly get up to speeds of 13/14 mph without much additional input. Most customers buy a NANO for hills and general support rather than speed.\\\\nWhat is NANO\\\\u2019s performance up hills?\\\\nIt is not a motorbike, so you do have to pedal on hills, but we have scores of very happy customers who can sail up and down hills so much more easily once the NANO system is fitted.\\\\nWhat weight can the NANO motor comfortably take?\\\\nObviously the lighter the person/bike the better the motor will perform. For an 85kg man, the NANO motor can comfortably do 13/14mph on level ground and easily go up hills as long as you are pedalling. You will find that going up hills is about as easy as pedalling on the flat.\\\\nWhat weight can the NANO comfortably pull?\\\\nAs reviewed in A to B magazine, the NANO motor can comfortably pull a children\\\\u2019s tag along with a child on it, or a children\\\\u2019s trailer with 2 small children in it.\\\\nHow waterproof is the NANO system ?\\\\nThe motor is sealed, we use special waterproof connectors and the battery is in a damp-proof fabric cover inside a Brompton bag. We have tested a bike outside all year and have not had any problems.\\\\nWill the NANO Motor fit any Bike?\\\\nAlmost any bike. At the moment, in addition to Bromptons, we can supply kits for Moultons and some Dahons and can convert other bikes on a special projects basis.\\\\nCan I buy a NANO motor conversion without a battery?\\\\nSure, you can supply your own battery if it is the same as the ones we supplu. Then you just ned an adapter from us - from \\\\u00a350.\\\\nYou used to offer a battery repair service, why has that stopped?\\\\nIn the past we have been able to buy replacement cells, but our supplier has changed their cells so unfortunately, we can no longer provide a repair service as the new cells are not compatible with the original cells.\\\\nWhat range can I expect from the NANO and how long will the batteries last?\\\\nOn a fully charged 13Ah battery, based on an average male (70kg) cycling in normal conditions, then you can expect a range of between 25 miles (just with the pedal s going round \\\\u2013 not much effort) and up to 50 miles depending on the amount of pedalling you do, hills etc. The 4Ah batteries will give 8 - 16 miles on the same basis.\\\\nThe batteries will last for 2/3 years or around 800/1000 re-charge cycles. Like all batteries there will be some reduction in range \\\\u2013 around 10/15% per year.\\\\nCan I take my battery on a plane?\\\\nYes, batteries over 160Wh are classed as dangerous goods and not allowed on passenger planes. The Bosch 4Ah battery is 144w/h so is allowed on a plane. You may need to arrange approval in advance so check with your airline.\\\\nSee IATA information for more details.\\\\nHow do I charge my battery ?\\\\nSimply take the battery out of the bag and clip onto the charger supplied. Plug the changer into any wall socket to charge.\\\\nHow long does it take to charge the battery ?\\\\nFrom empty the 4Ah batteries will take about an hour and the 13Ah about 6 hours.\\\\nHow noisy are the chargers ?\\\\nThe current range of batteries have almost silent chargers.\\\\nCan I charge my battery with an inverter?\\\\nYes, our chargers can be used with an inverter which is rated 150w or more, but we recommend use with a 200w pure sine wave inverter.\\\\nCan I charge my battery outside the UK?\\\\nSome chargers are rated for use worldwide. They are supplied with a UK lead, but we can provide an EU lead on request. For use in other countries use an adapter or buy a lead locally.\\\\nWhat are the running costs of a NANO system?\\\\nThe only running cost is the cost of electricity to charge the battery. It costs pence not pounds to fully recharge the battery.\\\\nWhich throttle does the NANO motor conversion kit include?\\\\nFor Bromptons (except P handle bars) we supply the twist throttle as standard. This is usually fitted on the right handlebar and is similar in use to a motorcycle throttle so is very intuitive. The further you twist it the more power you receive. We can also supply left hand fitting throttles on request.\\\\nFor P handlebars, or if preferred, we can provide a thumb throttle which can be fitted on the right or left handlebar.\\\\nIn both cases we replace your left handlebar grip to match.\\\\nThe button control is for customers who don\\\\u2019t want to have to hold a throttle. This offers 6 speed settings and is fitted within easy reach on the handlebars.\\\\nWhen can I use the power assistance?\\\\nHow do I cut power to the motor?\\\\nStop pedalling, release the grip on the twist or thumb throttle, (as its spring loaded it will automatically turn off) or apply the brakes which will cut the motor.\\\\nCan I fit the nano kit myself ?\\\\nAbsolutely \\\\u2013 over half our customers each year fit the kits themselves \\\\u2013 they come with full fitting instructions and we are always at the end of the phone if you have any questions.\\\\nAlternatively we can fit the system for you. At one of our workshops it usually takes about 3 hours, so we can do it while you wait.\\\\nDo I have to take the bottom bracket off to fit the pedal sensor ?\\\\nYes, on the Brompton you do have to remove the bottom bracket to fit the pedal sensor. We can lend you the tools to do that if you don\\\\u2019t have them yourself.\\\\nAre there any Bromptons that the nano system can\\\\u2019t be fitted on ?\\\\nNo, the system can be fitted onto any age of Brompton. Some of the older models may need new handlebars (\\\\u00a330) as the old ones were larger in diameter. It is also sometimes necessary to change the mudguard stay as again the older ones were thicker (\\\\u00a320).\\\\nWhat about widening my forks ?\\\\nWe have fitted thousands of nano systems over more than 10 years now so we know that the slight expansion of the steel forks is perfectly safe. We supply full instructions and a tool for this purpose so you don\\\\u2019t need to worry.\\\\nWhere can I bring my bike in for a nano fitting ?\\\\nOur main site is in Leamington Spa but we also have fitting services in London, Manchester, Yeovil and Burbage (nr Marlborough).\\\\nHow do I send my Brompton to you for fitting on the Collect/Fit/Return service ?\\\\nCan a nano system be fitted onto the rear wheel ?\\\\nNot on a Brompton but we can supply rear wheel motors for other bikes for example a Birdy.\\\\nI have a titanium Brompton; can I still have a NANO motor conversion?\\\\nYes, but front forks will have to be changed to steel - we can supply these in black or other Brompton colours.\\\\nCan you supply pre-widened forks?\\\\nYes - we have stocks in most colours or you can send us your forks and for \\\\u00a320 we can widen them and return them when we ship the rest of your NANO system.\\\\nWhat is the best way to widen the slots on the forks ?\\\\nYou can either do this with a file or an angle grinder. You are literally just taking off the depth of a pen line so around 10 minutes per slot for filing is about right.\\\\nI don\\\\u2019t like the big Brompton bags \\\\u2013 do you have anything smaller ?\\\\nYes we can supply a compact 6 Ortleib waterproof bag which is really just the size of the battery \\\\u2013 you can fit keys and a phone in as well but that will be about it. This is specifically for customers who only want a small, light bag on the front.\\\\nI need a big bag to take everything with me on the Brompton \\\\u2013 which bag do you recommend ?\\\\nWe can convert any of the Brompton bags to work with the nano system so you have a wide choice. The T bag is the largest with a capacity of 31litres but there are lots of other choices too. Call or email for the full details.\\\\nI don\\\\u2019t want a bag for the battery \\\\u2013 why can\\\\u2019t it just be on the front ?\\\\nThe nano system is specifically designed to have the battery protected in a bag and to work with either the One click\\\\u2019 Brompton luggage system or a handlebar stem connector on other bikes. We believe the battery should be in a bag and not open to the elements or creating a potential danger if damaged in an accident.\\\\nCan I use my existing Brompton bag ?\\\\nSure \\\\u2013 we have a bag wiring package so your existing bag can be converted for use with the nano system.\\\\nCan I buy a pre converted bag from you ?\\\\nOf course, we have variety of bags in stock and will always buy in anything else as required. These are then available already converted and ready to use.\\\\nCan I buy a new Brompton with a nano motor already fitted?\\\\nYes - we sell 30 - 40 new Bromptons fitted with a NANO system every year. We are not bike dealers however we have teamed up with some Brompton dealers and between us we can provide you a complete electric Brompton ready to ride in around 10 days depending on the Brompton spec chosen.\\\\nCan I buy a used nano ?\\\\nSure \\\\u2013 they occasionally come up on Ebay, Gumtree etc although do be careful the one you are buying is not stolen. Always ask for the serial number and the frame number. The serial number is at the bottom of the handlebar stem and the frame number is stamped into the steel below that. If the bike is being sold without a bag or battery that is suspicious.\\\\nWhat is the difference between Brompton\\\\u2019s own electric bike and the nano ?\\\\nNot much in terms of the motor. Lots in terms of our better availability, price and delivery dates.\\\\nTheir operation is on top of the battery and accessed by leaning through the handlebars but the nano throttle options are all easy to access on the handlebars.\\\\nWe fit a pedal sensor so you only have to have the pedals moving to use the motor, whatever speed you are doing. Theirs is a torque sensor so it balances out your effort in with the motor.\\\\nOverall the view is that the Electric Brompton is a prettier but more expensive and more limited version of a nano !! See the A to B article for more information.\\\\nWhat about the motors that fit straight in without having to widen the forks ?\\\\nThere are a couple of systems available now that claim to fit any bike and that the forks don\\'t have to be widened. We have investigated these and in a lot of cases the forks still do need to be widened slights and they include components that we have previously rejected because they don\\'t fit Brompton\\'s properly. You also have to buy their battery set up and in some cases that means not being able to have a bag on the luggage block. All in all we think you should buy a nano system !! Tried, trusted and reliable.\\\\nThe UN have designated batteries of this size as dangerous goods.\\\\nTherefore, they must be shipped in UN approved boxes with special labels and documentation. We ship all batteries in compliance with the UN regulations which means the shipping is more expensive, but it is legal.\\\\nI live outside the UK; can I have a NANO motor conversion?\\\\nWe can send kits almost anywhere in the world, although we usually recommend buying the battery locally to avoid the high shipping costs due to the batteries being classed as dangerous goods. Please bear in mind that the fitting instructions are in English and the warranty is on \\'Return to base\\\\u2019, so you would be responsible for the cost of any returns.\\\\nIs the NANO motor legal?\\\\nDo I have to have a license or road tax to ride NANO motor ebike on the roads?\\\\nIn Europe, Australia and most states in America you do not need a license, a test, road tax or MOT to ride an electric bike. Always check your local legislation.\\\\nDoes fitting the NANO motor affect my bike warranty?\\\\nYes, most bike manufacturers will not recognise their warranty once an electric conversion is added to their bike.\\\\nWhat warranty is there for a NANO motor conversion?\\\\nWe offer a 12-month warranty against manufacturing defects on the motor system and the battery.\\\\nThis is on a return to base basis, so you must return the bike or parts to us for repair or replacement.\\\\nWhat happens if the something breaks ?\\\\nWe can supply replacement parts such as pedal sensors, brake sensors, throttles etc with information on how to change them over or you can come into one of our workshops for the work to be done. Alternatively almost any bike shop should be able to do this simple repair for you.\\\\nThe NANO motor is in the front wheel which is also one of the easiest to remove of any ebike. We have fitted special waterproof connectors at critical points; one is by the motor, so it is easy to take the wheel off and repair the puncture as normal.\\\\nAre the rings a problem ?\\\\nAt one time there was an issue with the motor rings but these have been changed in the last few years resulting in this not being a problem any more.If the ring or the freewheel do go we will replace them free of charge within 12 months or for \\\\u00a385 after that. Just send us the wheel or bring it in for the work to be done. You can tell if you have a problem with the ring as the motor will work when the wheel is in the air but not if it is under any load.\\\\nCan I use the bike like an ordinary bike?\\\\nYes. If you don\\'t use the throttle at all, then the front wheel free wheels just like a normal bike. Or you can pedal as well as using the motor which gives you greater speed and uses less of the battery\\\\u2019s power, enabling you to go further.\\\\nCan a NANO motor be converted back to a normal bike?\\\\nYou can, although we are sure you would not want to. The wiring and components could be easily stripped out but to fit the motor the front forks will have been widened so you would need to replace them with new forks.\\\\nI have a dynamo hub at the moment \\\\u2013 can I have a nano system ?\\\\nSure, we will replace your dynamo hub with the nano motor and we can then fit lighting to run off your nano battery if required.We usually have to replace the front light with one including a regulator but can often use your existing back light.\\\\nCredit card, bank transfer or cheque.You can also pay by PayPal but there is a 3% surcharge due to their high fees and poor exchange rates.\\\\nDoes the NANO conversion affect the Brompton fold or the overall size?\\\\nNo, the system is specifically designed for the Brompton, so the fold is completely unaffected. There is also no overall increase in size so will still fit hard sided luggage etc.\\\\nI had a NANO conversion a few years ago what are the differences now?\\\\nThe main differences are that the controller is now placed more discretely by the luggage block all the cables are tidier. The brake sensor is attached with Velcro which fits all brake levers. There is a wider choice of batteries and most people now have the smaller, lighter 4Ah batteries (range 8 - 16 miles) which also re-charge in about an hour with an almost silent charger. These batteries use the same in-bag connector. Pedal sensors are also fitted now on all systems to comply with new UK regulations.\\\\nCan you increase the power out of my NANO ?\\\\nNo. The power levels are set as per the legal requirements in the UK and to get the best performance from the motor. Customers worldwide find the nano gives them what they need in terms of support from the motor not speed.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"The Volvo V40 is a really compelling car. It\\\\u2019s got that classy but understated, distinctly Scandinavian feel to it that sets it apart from arguably more bland rivals like the Audi A3 and BMW 1-Series. The problem is that it sometimes felt like the V40 put character ahead of the basic objective abilities that are critical in the ever-competitive family hatchback class. A criticism that the jacked-up but still front-wheel-drive Cross Country model, like our test car, was even more guilty of.\\\\nThis update has got a limited chance of changing that, unfortunately. The key change for this facelift is the addition of new XC90-style LED headlights that are \\\\u2013 impressively \\\\u2013 standard across the whole V40 range. However, this is also the first time we\\\\u2019ve driven the super-efficient D2 engine; a detuned 118bhp version of the 2.0-litre diesel that is the backbone of Volvo\\\\u2019s entire stable, and which joined the V40 range last year but has seen emissions reduced with this update.\\\\nCompany car drivers will rejoice in emissions of 89g/km in the standard V40, while the Cross Country manages 96g/km. The chassis, suspension and steering remain the same as before, as does the interior apart for some extra trim finishes.\\\\nThe engine is a big improvement. Previously, the 1.6 diesel was prone to pretty old-school turbo lag, but gone is the great lethargy followed by a brief stampede of torque; the 2.0-litre delivers far from rapid performance but it arrives in a much more linear fashion. Sure, you have to let it stray into quite unseemly-sounding revs to get decent acceleration. But the 10.6sec 0-62mph time is still perfectly respectable up against similarly efficiency-led rivals, and if you\\\\u2019re happy to live at a middling pace then the V40 D2 is easy to punt about in the accessible mid-range without having to work the six-speed gearbox too often.\\\\nLess ideal is the ride and handling. Raised by 40mm over the standard car, that extra spring travel inevitably results in plenty of body roll - not always progressively executed - and you don\\\\u2019t get a particularly great ride comfort, either. The damping rarely lets things feel really sharp-edged, but the body bobs and dips about all the time, and bigger bumps send an ungainly shudder through the car if cornering forces are involved. Tyre noise \\\\u2013 particularly a very intrusive slap over expansion joints \\\\u2013 is the worst aspect of the adequate-at-best refinement in the V40 Cross Country.\\\\nStill, the steering is slick and weighty enough, and while the Cross Country understeers with gusto without much provocation, you always know how much grip you\\'ve got left to work with.\\\\nAs we\\\\u2019ve said, it\\\\u2019s all much the same apart from that. The interior still looks lovely, benefits from excellent seats and feels easily good enough quality to give the best premium rivals something to worry about. It\\\\u2019s a shame that there\\\\u2019s no sign of a version of Volvo\\'s Sensus touchscreen that graces the XC90, since the button-heavy infotainment system is a bit of a faff to use. You\\\\u2019ll also enjoy a more useful boot and roomier back seats in an Audi A3 or VW Golf, so for the tedious practicalities of family hatchback life, the V40 is far from the best on offer.\\\\nIf you really like Volvo\\\\u2019s understated Scando-swagger, then the new engine and generous levels of equipment (better than you\\\\u2019ll find on an A3, for instance) mean that it\\\\u2019s more recommendable than ever. Company car drivers in particular might be tempted by the tax-busting CO2 figure, and it\\\\u2019s in this capacity that the V40 D2 makes most sense.\\\\nWhether you\\\\u2019re buying privately or as a business user, go for the workaday V40 D2 if you can, since this will drive better and be usefully cheaper than the pseudo off-road Cross Country variant. After all, other than superior clearance, you get no gains in off-road or towing ability, and the driving position is hardly SUV-like.\\\\nWe\\\\u2019d still save a wedge of cash and just go for an equivalent VW Golf, given that the V40 doesn\\\\u2019t offer the most polished dynamic repertoire, nor the most practical cabin. Despite all that, it\\\\u2019s easy to see why you would.\\\\n\\\\\"since the button-heavy infotainment system is a bit of a faff \\\\\"\\\\nA poor attempt at a stop gap?\\\\nI appreciate the style Volvo, I do, but, perhaps as a rebound reaction to the overly boxy designs of yore, you have almost completely abandoned practicality. I took a good look at a V40 recently and found the back seats useless for above average height adults, the boot too small and it all felt a little claustrophobic inside. But I like Volvos generally and so I looked at the V60. What did I find? Another style led package with what must be the smallest boot of its segment. Can we have style and packaging please Volvo? You have shown us that you can do it with the new XC90.\\\\nA second rate piece of kit that doesn\\'t measure up on so many fronts.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"An Ethernet is primarily a group of LAN technologies which are covered in IEEE 802.3 u standard. The ethernet is easily maintained and managed and considered to be low-cost network implementation solution. It comes in three variations, 10Base-T ethernet, fast ethernet and gigabit ethernet. The main difference between fast ethernet and gigabit ethernet is the contradicting speed where fast ethernet provides at maximum 100 Mbps of data transmission speed whereas gigabit ethernet offers high-speed data transmission up to 1 Gbps.\\\\nBasic Offers 100 Mbps speed. Provide 1 Gbps speed.\\\\nDelay Generate more delay. Less comparatively.\\\\nConfiguration Simple Complicated and create more errors.\\\\nCoverage Can cover distance up to 10 km. Has the limit of 70 km.\\\\nRelation Successor of 10-Base-T Ethernet. A successor of fast Ethernet.\\\\nThe fast Ethernet was devised under the name of 802u to contend for LAN protocol FDDI. It is completely based on 10-Base-T ethernet as it is a successor of 10-Base-T Ethernet. It was popular because it is simple to implement, manage and maintain. The fast ethernet has the advantage of backward compatibility. It is ten times faster than its successor and is capable of providing data speed of 100 Mbps. There are three varieties of fast ethernet \\\\u2013 100Base-T4, 100Base-Tx and 100Base-Fx.\\\\nMAC layer of fast ethernet is different from the standard ethernet where the data rate and collision domain are altered. The data rate is incremented by the factor of 10 and collision rate is decremented by the factor of 10. Although, there exhibit no change in frame format, then how did it achieve ten times faster speed without changing frame format? To accomplish this, the RTT (Round trip time) has reduced from 57.6 to 5.76 microseconds.\\\\nThe time needed for a signal pulse or a packet to traverse from a certain source to a particular destination and return from there again is known as Round trip time or Round-trip delay.\\\\nThe Gigabit Ethernet was devised to provide a higher rate of transmission up to 1 Gbps. The prior intention was to develop a technology that can properly work on existing networking equipment. It is constructed on the top of the Ethernet protocols such as CSMA/CD. Both the modes full duplex and half duplex are supported by it, similar to fast ethernet.\\\\nIn the beginning single-mode, multi-mode fibre and short-haul coax cable are used. After that, twisted pair cable standards were also included. Gigabit rates are achieved by using physical channel technology as a standard over the optical fibres.\\\\nThe fibre optic cable is majorly used instead of coaxial cable and twisted pair cable.\\\\nMAC layer has also modified in gigabit ethernet. It uses carrier extension to detect frames coming from a larger distance.\\\\nTo manage flow control the X-on/X-off protocols are used, that work over any of the full-duplex Ethernet. This helps in stopping the transmission when a switch buffer is near to its capacity.\\\\nThe quality of service (QoS) is supported by gigabit ethernet with the help of signalling scheme so that the real-time packets get the better treatment.\\\\nThe data rate provided by fast ethernet is up to 100 Mbps. On the other hand, gigabit ethernet offers up to 1 Gbps speed.\\\\nAs the speed is increased in Gigabit ethernet, so the delay is decreased whereas the fast ethernet generates more delay.\\\\nThe configuration of fast ethernet is simpler than gigabit ethernet.\\\\nThe distance covered by fast ethernet is at most 10 km. On the contrary, the gigabit ethernet covers 70 km.\\\\nRound trip delay of fast ethernet is 100-500 bit times. As against, gigabit ethernet has the delay of 4000 bit times.\\\\nFast Ethernet and gigabit ethernet are the types of ethernet where fast ethernet is slower than gigabit ethernet and provide maximum data speed up to 100 Mbps. On the other hand, the gigabit ethernet has extended its speed at maximum to 1 Gbps by improving cabling technology, MAC layer, flow control protocols and quality of service.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Sometimes premature effacement (shortening of the vaginal portion of the cervix and thinning of the walls) and dilation of the cervix is not caused by labor, but rather by structural weakness in the cervix itself. This is called cervical incompetence.\\\\nThe weakness can result from a number of conditions, most due to prior injury to the cervix or resulting from an inherited physical condition of the cervix.\\\\nWhen the cervix is damaged, it cannot hold the weight of the pregnancy. The cervix dilates without contractions or pain, sometimes opening completely. The dilation results in the amniotic membranes bulging through the opening and eventually rupturing, often before the baby can survive outside of the uterus. This irritates the uterus and brings on pre-term labor. In many cases, labor is detected when it is too far advanced to stop the process.\\\\nCervical incompetence accounts for about 15 to 20 percent of all pregnancy losses during the second trimester.\\\\nRisk factors for an incompetent cervix are: a history of incompetent cervix with a previous pregnancy, surgery, cervical injury, DES (diethylstilbestrol) exposure, and anatomic abnormalities of the cervix. A prior D&C can, for example, damage the cervix.\\\\nOther causes of cervical weakness include cervical cautery (to remove growths or stop bleeding) and cone biopsy (removal of a cone-shaped section of tissue for study to detect possible precancerous growth). Prior to pregnancy or during the first trimester, there is usually no method to determine whether the cervix will eventually be incompetent.\\\\nWomen with incompetent cervix typically present with \\\\\"silent\\\\\" cervical dilation (i.e., with minimal uterine contractions) between 16 and 28 weeks of gestation. They present with significant cervical dilation (2 cm or more) and minimal symptoms. When the cervix reaches 4 cm or more, active uterine contractions or rupture of membranes may occur.\\\\nDiagnosis is made by medical history, physical exam, and ultrasound study. A pregnancy test will also be performed.\\\\nOnce the problem of incompetence is diagnosed, the condition may be treatable through a surgical procedure called cerclage (stitching the cervix closed). One or more stitches are placed around or through the cervix to keep it tightly closed.\\\\nThis is usually performed after the twelfth week of pregnancy, the time after which a woman is least likely to miscarry for other reasons - but it is not done if there is rupture of the membranes or infection.\\\\nAfter surgery, the mother is carefully monitored to check for infection and contractions, which are sometimes brought on by the procedure. After hospital discharge, the patient may remain on bedrest in order to remove any pressure on the cervix and increase the chance of retaining the pregnancy until the baby is viable. The cerclage is usually removed just before childbirth so that the patient can give birth vaginally. In some cases, the cerclage may be left in place, and the baby is then delivered by cesarean section.\\\\nIs there a structural weakness in the cervix?\\\\nTo what extent is this a threat to pregnancy?\\\\nDo you plan to operate?\\\\nWill a successful vaginal birth be possible?\\\\nIs a cesarean section indicated?\"}\\n',\n",

This article will describe the Brodick Castle ghosts and a history of Brodick Castle.\\\\nA Grey Lady haunts Brodick Castle and this is thought to be a servant girl from Cromwellian times. She had a love affair with the Captain of the Guard and became pregnant and was then dismissed from service at the Castle. She tried to return to her family in nearby Corrie but they disowned her. Distraught, she went to the Wine Port Quay by the entrance to Brodick Castle and drowned herself. Her ghost haunts the servant areas of the Castle such as the kitchen, lower corridor and the Turnpike stairs which lead to the East Tower and the Battlements. Witnesses have seen her overlooking staff who have been scrubbing the Castle floors as if talking to them. Yet when the witnesses told the staff they denied seeing her standing over them or talking with the Grey Lady Castle ghost.\\\\nOther sources think that the Grey Lady Castle ghost was a woman who was locked in the dungeons with two other women and died of starvation. They were locked in the Castle dungeons because they had the Black Death.\\\\nIn the Castle Library a ghost has been seen. It is the spirit of an old man but no-one knows who he is or why he haunts Brodick Castle.\\\\nA White Hart (a Stag) is said to appear in the grounds of Brodick Castle when the Clan Chief of the Hamilton\\\\ufffds is about to die.\\\\nBrodick Castle is a red sandstone building and the name Brodick is Norse for Broad Bay. An ancient Viking fort is thought to have been on the site. In the 5th century an Irish tribe came across the waters and founded the Kingdom of Dalriada.\\\\nBrodick Castle dates back to the 13th century though not as it is seen now. It was built by the Stewarts. In 1406 English troops destroyed the Castle. In 1503 the Earldom of Arran and with it Brodick Castle were granted to Lord Hamilton by his cousin King James IV. A Tower House was rebuilt in 1510 by the new Earl though suffered attacks by the Campbells and the MacLeans. In 1544 the Castle was demolished. It was rebuilt and the parts that were rebuilt in 1588 still exist today. During that era it was owned by the 2nd Earl of Arran, the guardian and regent of Queen Mary. In the middle of the 17th century it was owned by the 1st Duke of Hamilton until his execution in 1648 by Oliver Cromwell during the Civil War. He then placed his garrison of 80 soldiers at Brodick Castle and had it further restored. The 2nd Duke of Hamilton died in battle in 1651.\\\\nThe Castle remained unoccupied for many years, though the husband of Duchess Anne, William Douglas the 1st Earl of Selkirk who later became the Duke of Hamilton, used the Castle as a base for his hunting trips. It then became a sporting estate until the son of the 10th Duke of Hamilton took up residence.\\\\nIn 1843 William the 11th Duke of Hamilton married the daughter of the Grand Duke of Baden, the Princess Marie who was the adopted daughter of Napoleon Bonaparte after his marriage to her mother St\\\\ufffdphanie de Beauharnais.\\\\nMajor restoration and building work was undertaken in 1844 and the size of the Castle was greatly increased. The Architect was James Gillespie Graham.\\\\nWilliam, the 12th Duke of Hamilton, had no male heirs and his title passed to his cousin Alfred when he died though the Castle was inherited by the 12th Duke\\\\ufffds daughter. She married the 6th Duke of Montrose, James Graham in 1906 and became Lady Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton. This marked the passing of the Castle from the Hamilton family after over 500 years of ownership. She died in 1957 and her daughter, Lady Jean Fforder transferred ownership over to the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) rather than pay death duties. The Castle and gardens then became open to the public. The ghosts of Brodick Castle remain.\\\\nVisitors may be able to see the Brodick Castle ghosts and can also view the many examples of period furniture, paintings and porcelain collections. Art collections include the art collection of 18th century author William Beckford of Fonthill whose daughter married the 10th Duke of Hamilton.\\\\nVisitors to the Brodick Castle gardens can visit the Ice House, the Walled Garden, the Bavarian Summer House, and enjoy many flowers and plants such as rhododendrons.\\\\nIn 1977 a hidden staircase was discovered during restoration work. It led to a hidden room deep within the thick castle walls.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Ringing Lines? But I don\\'t have any phones on my OS/32 system. What is Baker talking about now! Well, I am talking about an insidious problem that could be robbing your system of precious computer power without your even being aware of it! At this very moment your asynchronous lines could be bombarding your system with interrupts, and if you have a 3280, you don\\'t even have a wait light to give you any hint of trouble!\\\\nThe ringing lines I am referring to are the standard asynchronous communications lines provided by your 2/8 Line CommMux or your systems MPC board. Your system is most susceptible to this problem if you have long cables that are not connected to a terminal or, in some cases, are connected to a terminal that is switched off. This is not a trivial problem, one SDECM line ringing at 38,400 bps can use up 20% of a 3280\\'s resources!\\\\nWhat causes this rather unexpected phenomenon? Induction. You might liken it to the Atlantis space shuttle experiment with its 12 mile tether, but instead of 12 miles of cable and the earth\\'s magnetic field, you have 100 feet with a transmit and receive wire running next to each other. When a character is sent down the transmit line, it produces voltage fluctuations that in turn induce a signal into the receive line. When your port is not assigned to a program like SDECM or MTM, the BIOC or CTD driver respond with a bell for every character received. The intent of the bell is to alert a user that the character they just typed was not processed. But, when the received character is generated by induction, the bell code simply produces more voltage fluctuations causing induction to generate yet another receive character.\\\\nHow can you determine if you are having ringing problems? That question is not easy to answer. If your unused ports are not under the control of a program, the ringing is very hard to detect. If you are a systems sleuth, the BIOC driver has an entry point named BIO.BLCT (BIOc BelL CounT) that counts the total number of times it has sounded off with a bell. This is a halfword in the BIOC driver, not in the DCB. The count reflects the total number of bells sent for all terminals. If this halfword becomes negative (>32767) BIOC stops sending the bell code. If you check this location and find it incrementing quickly, you definitely have one or more ringing terminals, the trick is to find out which one is the culprit.\\\\nA much easier approach to locating a ringing line is to add all of your ports into the latest (R05-18) version of SDECM. SDECM keeps track of the number of reads and writes issued for each line. The counts are displayed in response to a STatus command. Additionally, you may set a threshold for the I/O count. Once set, SDECM warns you when any terminal reaches the count by posting a message on the system console.\\\\nIs there anything you can do if you determine your system has ringing lines, or if you are just cautious and want to insure you never have this trouble? Yes, fortunately the solution is simple.\\\\nRon Stordahl has solved the problem. Ron has over 300 terminals on his 3280 MPS. Many of his terminals run at 38,400 bps with lines as long as 300 feet. This combination is enough the make the designers of the RS232 standard faint dead away, but Ron is getting away with it. Since Ron has so many lines on his system, he is sure to get a terminal turned off or disconnected on a daily bases. These ringing lines were costing him a lot of computer resources. So, one day he sat down with an oscilloscope and proceeded to solve the ringing line dilemma. After much study Ron came up with the following solution. In the back shell of the 15 Pin plug connect a 510 ohm, 1/8 watt resistor between Pin 11 (Receive Data) and Pin 15 (Ground). This resistor dissipates the induced voltage to ground before it is detected by the UART, without causing interference with characters transmitted by the terminal. It has been tested with cable lengths up to 300 feet using terminals running at 38,400 bps. So, if you are having problems with ringing lines, it\\'s nice to know that a handful of resistors and a little work may recover enough computer resources that you won\\'t need to upgrade your CPU. Now that I have saved you all of that money, it\\'s time to consider putting those unused ports to use communicating with other computers. If you need help, you know where to turn.\\\\nWell that about does it for this issue. I am looking forward to seeing old friends and meeting new people at Interchange 92. By the time you read this, your plans should be made and you should be getting ready to depart. I know we are going to have a good turnout. See you at the Fairmont Hotel in New Orleans. Come visit us at Booth 15.\\\\nAn addendum to my last article on the LIMS 244 Driver. After that article was written, a problem was discovered in the 244 and BIOC drivers distributed with the LIMS system. This problem prevents these drivers from working with modems. A defective SCR was included that prevents the DTR control from working properly. Never fear, SBS came to the rescue. Perkin-Elmer now has a revised driver library that contains a corrected version of the 244 and BIOC drivers. If you plan on using either of these drivers with modems or for processor to processor communications, insure that the inclusion date on your 244 driver (INITLIDD) in your USERDLIB.LIB file is at least July 17, 1992. You can use the DIR command of OBJECT32 to view the inclusion date. Contact Perkin-Elmer if you need an update to your driver library.\"}\\n',\n",

What bliss. Never again to be repeated. I enjoyed every single minute of it. I even put up with having to do the very small dissertation and the half-a-dozen essays necessary to receive an honours bachelor\\'s degree.\\\\nI spent all these precious years learning to draw, investigating techniques that today come so naturally to me. My friend Nick (see my \\\\\"Oscar\\\\\" acceptance speech posting) taught me to draw, although he will insist that he just drew it out of me. He tells me that because the interest and talent were there to be encouraged, the rest was easy.\\\\nI continue learning to this day but these old sketch books are full of evidence of how I spent every minute of every day doing my first-ever investigations into light and shade, tone and texture. Even when I was out picking blackberries with friends, or travelling around Norfolk in the car with my Mum, I always had a sketch-book and I now realise that I wrote notes to describe everything that I saw, the colours, the textures and even my emotional reactions to a scene.\\\\nI wrote notes describing my ideas and design developments, and even then I was writing about my soul. I described how I was expressing myself through pictures in a way that I found difficult to do with the spoken word.\\\\nA lucky discovery! I now have enough photographs from these \\\\u201cSusie Mallett archives\\\\\" to fill my blog for several years and I can share some of my surprise discoveries.\\\\nI painted from nature, landscapes and sometimes townscapes, I loved to draw trees, I suppose I can say that I was and still am fascinated by them, passionate about them. Their spiralling trunks and branches, their bark patterns and their overpowering greatness were a never-ending source of inspiration and awe. I wrote my dissertation on the wind something else that fascinates me, with a power even greater than that of a tree, able to fell a tree in the blink of an eye.\\\\nAll of this I read about in these \\\\u201cancient\\\\u201d sketch books. The writings I have no recollection of, and I read the words as if someone else had written them. The painting and drawings that accompany these I remember as if I had done them yesterday, every stroke of the brush and every mark made by a pencil.\\\\nAs I was drafting this posting on the bus on my way to the airport I looked out of the window at the passing landscape and made a few marks in my note book. I began to think about how I look at things, about how I described this in my sketch books all those years ago, and how I do it automatically these days. I contemplated how I make quick observations just as I do in my conductive work, and how I can translate these into pencil marks and perhaps have enough stored information to elaborate on it later. I still look at landscapes as I did then, like a sheet of music, the receding lines of the fields being the staves and the black trunks of the trees with their dark clumps of leaves and needles, the notes dotted on them. The landscape or a townscape is music in my ears inspiring me to put pencil or paint to paper.\\\\nI have carried a book and a pencil in my pocket since 1975. Once this would have been full of pictures, with a few words, but for over a year now, since just before I started my blog in fact, this has changed, there are now more words than pictures.\\\\nIt was so interesting to see where my ideas and interest in shape, form and colour began and follow its progress through the years through these sketch books, right up to the present day.\\\\nAs I finished writing this in the plane (Air Berlin), out of the corner of my eye I could see Mr Bean on the television screen.

              " '{\"text\": \"Countless interpretations of these passages have been offered, and I\\\\u2019m not going to pretend as though I have the definitive interpretation to it either. However, I do believe I have something worthwhile to offer, namely a view which endorses the Law of God and the teaching of His prophets, as well as a necessary change of Law (a \\\\u201ctransfiguration\\\\u201d of the Law and the Prophets, so to speak) which must take place when \\\\u201cheaven and earth\\\\u201d are to pass away. But first, we must ask and attempt to answer an obvious question which likely would have crossed the minds of Jesus\\\\u2019 first century Jewish audience.\\\\nWhy would anyone in Israel think that Jesus came to abolish the Law or the Prophets? Did Jesus come to teach in opposition to \\\\u201cthe Law\\\\u201d and the Prophets of God?\\\\nSo then, what did Jesus mean by \\\\u201cfulfill\\\\u201d?\\\\nIn order to answer this question, let\\\\u2019s take a quick tour through Matthew\\\\u2019s use of this very word, \\\\u201cfulfill,\\\\u201d in order to see how it is used throughout this Gospel.\\\\nNotice that according to Matthew\\\\u2019s own consistent use of this term to \\\\u201cfulfill\\\\u201d, it always occurs alongside citations from the Old Testament Scriptures. Taking that into account, along with it\\\\u2019s more straight-forward literal meaning to \\\\u201cfill full\\\\u201d, one obvious interpretation of what Jesus meant was to embody what was foreshadowed by the Law and the Prophets, thereby \\\\u201cfilling full\\\\u201d what was lacking in them. In \\\\u201cThe Law\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cThe Prophets\\\\u201d of God we find clear illustrations of God\\\\u2019s holiness, loyal-love, righteous indignation, mercy, goodness, long-suffering, patience, and kindness. But did any single Israelite, or even any generation of Israel collectively, ever typify that reality?\\\\nEven a cursory glance through Scripture will show that the answer is clearly \\\\u2018No\\\\u2019. Israel was given the Law and the Prophets, but every individual Israelite and even Israel collectively was lacking something significant which needed to be filled full.\\\\nI realize that many Christians don\\\\u2019t accept this way of viewing the Law or the Prophets. But please bear with me and hear me out.\\\\nWhat was Israel lacking, which the Law and the Prophets could not fill full?\\\\nWe could also ask, what were the Law and the Prophets lacking?\\\\nThe answer is actually much more simple than what ordinarily meets the eye. Both the people of Israel, and the Law and the Prophets they had received were lacking the power to raise the dead and grant eternal life and immortality (I Tim 6:16; II Tim 1:10; I Cor 15:53-54; Rom 2:7). Jesus came to accomplish that, once for all time, and even for those righteous saints who had already died (Heb. 11:1-12:2). But in order to do so, the filling full of what they were lacking had to be according to the terms of God\\\\u2019s Law as spoken through His prophets. The Law and prophets functioned as a pedagogy of death, with limited access into the Divine presence. Even the Law itself instructed Israel about an inevitable \\\\\"time of reformation\\\\\" which would result in direct access to the Divine presence without fear of death (Heb. 2:14-15; 9:8-10). As long as the \\\\\"first tent\\\\\" (the Holy Place) was still standing, the Holy Spirit was indicating that the way into Holy places, where Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father, was not yet opened for the living or the dead. As I have indicated elsewhere in an academic paper, the book of Revelation teaches that after the definitive end of the old covenant administration, with the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple in 70 A.D., that access into Holy places is opened for all, and all the saints who have died in Christ ascend thrones, and they are each given authority over the nations to participate with Jesus in making all things new.\\\\nOnly the incarnation, death, resurrection, ascension, and vindication of the Son of God could open that way into the heavenly realities of eternal life with God (Heb 8:1-5). Not only did the temple of Jesus\\' Body have to be destroyed, but the Old Covenant temple and it\\'s whole system of administration needed to be destroyed along with him in order for the New Covenant kingdom to advance throughout the world, uniting heaven and earth together in his Church and thereby colonizing earth with the life of heaven.\\\\nSo then, in a secondary sense, the Law and the Prophets were not only lacking the power to destroy the power of death, but they were also lacking their promised Messiah, the incarnate Son of God, who alone could accomplish that cosmic task.\\\\nThis sentence admits of a twofold meaning. \\\\u2026By saying that He has not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it, He says that He is going to make it complete by adding what it lacks and that He is going to observe it by doing what it contains. \\\\u2026He does not destroy what He has found in the Law when He supplies what it lacked; on the contrary, He strengthens it by giving it completeness. \\\\u2026For, when one is observing what has been added for the sake of completeness, he is all the more surely observing what has been previously established as the foundation.\\\\nAccordingly, it cannot be said that Jesus came to end all usefulness of God\\\\u2019s Law or what his prophets taught. Indeed, the very opposite seems to be the case. Yet, as I mentioned at the beginning of this post, Jesus is not only endorsing the usefulness of God\\\\u2019s Law and the teaching of His prophets. He is also teaching that there will come a time when \\\\u201cheaven and earth\\\\\" will pass away, and when that occurs there must be a necessary change of Law (a \\\\u201ctransfiguration\\\\u201d of the Law and the Prophets, so to speak).\\\\nIn the next post I will try to bring clarity about when that time would be, and what that implies for Christians today. Here\\\\u2019s a teaser though: That time is not in our future. The first \\\\u201cHeaven and earth\\\\u201d already passed away.\"}\\n',\n",

Photosystem II captures sunlight and powers the unique photo-induced oxidation of water to atmospheric oxygen. Crystallographic investigations of cyanobacterial photosystem II have provided several medium-resolution structures (3.8 to 3.2 A) that explain the general arrangement of the protein matrix and cofactors, but do not give a full picture of the complex. Here we describe the most complete cyanobacterial photosystem II structure obtained so far, showing locations of and interactions between 20 protein subunits and 77 cofactors per monomer. Assignment of 11 beta-carotenes yields insights into electron and energy transfer and photo-protection mechanisms in the reaction centre and antenna subunits. The high number of 14 integrally bound lipids reflects the structural and functional importance of these molecules for flexibility within and assembly of photosystem II. A lipophilic pathway is proposed for the diffusion of secondary plastoquinone that transfers redox equivalents from photosystem II to the photosynthetic chain. The structure provides information about the Mn4Ca cluster, where oxidation of water takes place.

It\\\\u2019s the Lower Income Voucher Equity pilot program, and it could provide affordable homes to 400 households by the end of the year.\\\\nYou may remember this as the two-year pilot program that Chipotle wants to join. Comcast, Colorado Health Foundation and others have expressed interest too. Partnerships with employers are one way that the program will be funded, and in the case of Chipotle, such partnerships come with the opportunity to get their employees into the new housing.\\\\nBut as a pilot program with private-public partnerships baked in, and only 400 units to start, how are teachers supposed make their way into the mix? Soliv\\\\u00e1n says that the city is aiming for \\\\u201creasonable caps\\\\u201d from its private employers and considers the limited two-year pilot to be a way to assess and adjust the employer mix.\\\\nBefore any of this happens though, the vacant apartments still have to be identified. Soliv\\\\u00e1n says the city\\\\u2019s request for qualification should be online by \\\\u201cmid-ish\\\\u201d September.\\\\nFor building owners, the appeal for participating is immediate occupancy, not just curing societal ills. And that\\\\u2019s something that will be true even when vacancy rates come back down. Yes, the program happens to be timed well to the current rental market, but there will always be vacancies, Soliv\\\\u00e1n said.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"In anticipation of the first quarter earnings season that begins in earnest this week, stocks took a breather last week and consolidated recent gains. The S&P 500 Index rose modestly while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed virtually flat. Investors received a taste of the quarterly profit reports on Friday when JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo both reported better than expected revenue and earnings. Although Wells Fargo issued disappointing guidance, JP Morgan Chase maintained its earnings outlook for the year as it reported record profits that were helped by higher interest rates and strong consumer banking results. Investors should be encouraged by these initial results, but this week will be key as nearly fifty S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report first quarter earnings. The other important news items last week were minutes from the March Federal Reserve meeting and the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting to review monetary policy. The Fed minutes showed that the majority of its officials thought that the economic outlook was such that interest rates could be left unchanged for the entire year. Because of softening data on consumer spending and housing, weaker global economic growth and benign inflation, the Fed can afford to be more patient and should be much less inclined to hike rates. The ECB also made no changes to its monetary policy, announcing that it would not raise its benchmark interest rate until at least the end of 2019. The euro zone economy is weaker than the U.S. and risks there remained skewed to the downside as growth continues to slow. Investors had also become concerned recently about slowing growth in China, but the country reported stronger than expected export data in March, nearly double what economists had expected. There were positive developments in the ongoing trade talks with China, too, as both sides were close to agreeing on enforcement mechanisms when a deal is finally reached.\\\\nInflation data released last week indicated that prices remain under control. The consumer price index (CPI) in March recorded its biggest increase in over a year, but excluding food and energy, prices barely budged and the CPI has increased less than 2% during the last 12 months. The March producer price index (PPI) was also higher than expected but the core rate (excluding food and energy) of wholesale inflation was flat. Excluding petroleum, import prices in March edged up slightly and were flat for the past 12 months. February factory orders fell and were worse than expected due to weakness in machinery, transportation and electronics orders. Weekly jobless claims fell by 8,000 to 196,000, the lowest level since October 1969 and a sign that the labor market remains strong.\\\\nIn corporate news, Walt Disney announced a new streaming service that would compete with Netflix and Chevron announced plans to acquire Anadarko Petroleum for $33 billion in cash and stock. In overseas news, European Union leaders agreed to postpone the deadline on Brexit until October 31.\\\\nFor the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12 points to close virtually flat at 26,412 and the S&P 500 Index rose 0.5% to close at 2,907. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.6% to close at 7,984.\\\\nLeading economic indicators and retail sales for March are both expected to rebound strongly after posting tepid numbers in February that might have been weather-related. Housing starts and industrial production should also see an improvement over the previous month.\\\\nAmong the most notable companies scheduled to report first quarter earnings this week are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Charles Schwab, US Bancorp, SunTrust Banks, American Express, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, UnitedHealth, Abbott Labs, PepsiCo, Philip Morris International, Union Pacific, Honeywell and Schlumberger.\\\\nIf the first quarter earnings results from JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo are any indication, this earnings season could be better than most people expect. While two profit reports are a small sample size, the results were impressive and could set the tone for the remaining reporting season. We certainly will find out over the next two weeks as nearly 40% of S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report their earnings. Earnings are expected to decline about 4% from the year-ago quarter and analysts\\\\u2019 estimates have come down since the start of the year, lowering the bar that companies need to clear. The S&P 500 has risen over 16% this year and is now less than 1% from its all-time high, a move upward that has been the result of an expansion in the price earnings ratio, which is now at about 17 times forward earnings. This higher multiple could be the result of the Federal Reserve\\\\u2019s more dovish monetary policy and its more patient approach with regard to raising interest rates. It also could be due to the belief among economists that economic growth will increase in the second half of the year, leading to stronger corporate profit growth that would justify higher stock prices. For this reason, the outlook that companies provide for the balance of the year will be just as important as their first quarter earnings results.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"When trying to fill open positions, insurance recruiters and HR managers are often challenged to find creative ways to attract new talent. To get through some of the stereotypes of what it means to work in insurance, consider spreading the word of your company\\'s advancements, and give reasons why the next generation of job-seekers should consider your company when planning out their career goals. You may want to include some of the following concepts in your messaging.\\\\nAdvances in technology, the growth of social media, and an increasing focus on corporate consciousness have given rise to some exciting new insurance jobs. Here, we will dive into insurance careers that didn\\\\u2019t exist about a decade ago and prove that insurance is no longer the financial services industry of years gone by.\\\\nYou\\\\u2019re probably thinking a customer experience manager sounds a lot like a customer service rep. But before you have nightmares about call centers and headsets, know this insurance career is about much more than customer service.\\\\nA customer experience manager is an outgrowth of the tech world. Customer experience managers, also known as user experience managers (UX), have worked in the tech field for some time. UX positions in tech began by making sure that a website works well for a user.\\\\nToday, user experience managers work within many industries, including insurance. In the insurance world, a user experience manager studies and manages the way customers interact with a carrier on all levels. A customer experience manager may analyze social media interactions, develop omnichannel marketing campaigns and analyze customer focused website interactions. All the tasks are completed with an eye toward providing the best customer experience available.\\\\nHave a passion for creating a prime customer experience and interested in what makes a customer tick? Consider a customer experience role. The pay isn\\\\u2019t bad either. According to PayScale, a user experience manager can earn more than $100,000 per year.\\\\nThough not technically an \\\\\"insurance career,\\\\\" it\\\\u2019s undeniably one of the most unique insurance-related jobs. Some insurance carriers employ in-house specialists to help settle high-value personal property claims. For example, one large national carrier employs jewelers. When a claim involves a piece of jewelry, the carrier\\\\u2019s jewelers study the lost item, create a valuation, and then work to either repair or replace the piece with something of like quality and style.\\\\nSimilarly, insurance carriers employ or contract with art historians to help settle claims involving highly valuable art. When something goes wrong, the company must have a way to value and restore or replace the art So, before you change your art history major to business, consider employment with an insurance carrier.\\\\nSustainability isn\\\\u2019t just a buzz word, it\\\\u2019s a career. Like most corporations, large insurance carriers have a stake in sustainable practices and need sustainable managers to develop and oversee their programs.\\\\nSustainability managers play many roles. They may focus on recycling and waste reduction programs, green office building design, or reducing a carriers\\\\u2019 carbon footprint. Sustainability teams can also manage supplier contracts with an eye toward minimizing waste.\\\\nCorporations and insurance carriers know sustainability is connected to the bottom line, and with the growing demand for corporate consciousness, every carrier needs a plan. If you have a passion for environmentally responsible living and working, consider putting your skills to work for an insurance carrier.\\\\nSavvy insurance carriers embrace telecommuting and work-from-home programs. Such programs help carriers save money on operating expenses, such as office space and utilities. Flexible work programs also aid in recruitment efforts, as most workers crave flexibility and the opportunity to work remotely.\\\\nA recent Gallup poll found that among 15,000 adult workers surveyed, 43 percent worked from home at least some of the time. This is where offsite and telecommuting program managers come in.\\\\nA telecommuting program manager oversees the offsite operations of the company. The job entails handling issues that arise with an offsite team including technical problems and team performance.\\\\nThe position requires a high degree of technical know-how and superior communication skills. Offsite worker managers must also have exceptional leadership and team building skills to keep their team connected to the company culture.\\\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is knocking on the door of insurance. Some carriers have heartily answered the call and already use some AI processes for underwriting, claims, and customer service.\\\\nArtificial intelligence directors are in demand as AI trickles further into carrier operations. Such a position requires a solid understanding of AI and machine learning as well as a working knowledge of the insurance industry. The role entails providing counsel about AI to leadership teams. Directors also identify and prioritize opportunities for the integration of AI programs.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s no surprise the development of social media has expanded insurance careers. Social media has evolved from a place to keep up with friends into an outreach machine that ranks high on the list of marketing priorities.\\\\nInsurance carriers recognize the need to harness the power of social media marketing, while at the same time managing the social presence of the carrier. Enter social media strategists and managers.\\\\nSocial media strategists focus largely on optimizing social media platforms to build awareness and brand recognition for a carrier. Social media managers, on the other hand, are more engaged with social media users, attempting to foster discussions and grow a community around the carrier\\\\u2019s platforms.\\\\nA social media strategist position for an insurance carrier requires industry knowledge, superior communication skills, and mastery of social media platforms. According to Indeed.com a social media strategist in the Los Angeles area earns about $32.00 per hour.\\\\nIf you are in the market for an exciting job, give an insurance career some thought. While positions in claims, underwriting, and sales are the backbone of the business, insurance has more to offer than ever before. Advances in technology, marketing, and human resources have given rise to interesting and exciting positions. Insurance carriers are always on the lookout for new talent, so why not throw your hat in the ring?\"}\\n',\n",

However, a seemingly harmless nickname he gave to an NBC news anchor became highly controversial overnight. Trump has been referring to Meet the Press host Chuck Todd as \\\\u201cSleepy Eyes\\\\u201d for years, but the Internet now thinks that the term is a lesser-known anti-Semitic slur! Whether the President knowingly called Todd an anti-Semitic term is debatable. But is \\\\u201csleepy eyes\\\\u201d anti-Semitic?

But when does the POTUS\\\\u2019 almost juvenile name-calling enter dangerous waters?\\\\nTrump went about his routine Twitter tear into his opponents on April 22. Among those on the receiving end was NBC Meet the Press host, Chuck Todd.\\\\nTodd and Trump had exchanged words back and forth long before Trump began dabbling in politics. And when Todd questioned the president on his negotiations with North Korea, Trump took to Twitter to denigrate the news anchor.\\\\nWhile doing so, Trump used a nickname he has assigned to Todd; \\\\u201cSleepy Eyes.\\\\u201d To the unaware, it might honestly appear to be a harmless, schoolyard-level nickname we\\\\u2019ve come to expect from Trump.\\\\nHowever, a Twitter user named Sara Chadwick was quick to point out that isn\\\\u2019t the case.\\\\nChadwick, a survivor of the Florida high school shooting and now a March for Our Lives activist, pointed out that \\\\u201cSleepy Eyes\\\\u201d is actually an anti-Semitic slur!\\\\nAnother Twitter user named \\\\u201cStonekettle\\\\u201d posted a 10-part Twitter thread explaining that \\\\u201cSleepy Eyes\\\\u201d is anti-Jewish.\\\\nTrump has been addressing the journalist as \\\\u201cSleepy Eyes Chuck Todd\\\\u201d since 2012, but it never caused a stir until now.\\\\nGoogle Trends recorded a dormant search history related to \\\\u201cSleepy Eyes Anti Semitic\\\\u201d until Sunday, when Trump tweeted his jibe against Todd. Soon after, social media was flooded with queries on whether \\\\u201cSleepy Eyes\\\\u201d was really a slur.\\\\nThe evidence to support it is not easy to find. But it\\\\u2019s true that it is a derogatory term, albeit, no so frequently used.\\\\nIn fact, many might not even be aware of this term outside of another one of Trump\\\\u2019s petty nicknames.\\\\nHowever, there\\\\u2019s a certain age group of Holocaust survivors who would testify that this was a term used by the German Nazis. Propagandists in Nazi Germany had listed physical traits that differentiated Jews from Aryans.\\\\nSome of these stereotypical traits included curly hair, thick lips, large noses, and drooping or \\\\u201csleepy\\\\u201d eyes.\\\\nHistorian Peter Kenez also mentions the \\\\u201csleepy eyes\\\\u201d stereotype in his books. Kenez, who is a professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is a Holocaust survivor himself.\\\\nMoreover, Neo-Nazis continue to follow the stereotypical description of Jews today.\\\\nSearching through some of the disreputable corners of the Internet revealed pages of instruction on how to identify a Jew. The sleepy, drooping, bulging, or \\\\u201csad sack\\\\u201d eyes appear to be a recurring description.\\\\nWas Trump Being an Anti-Semite?\\\\nReferring to Todd with an obscure slur doesn\\\\u2019t necessarily make Trump anti-Semitic. The term becomes derogatory with the knowledge that Todd is Jewish from his mother\\\\u2019s side. However, before Sunday, it was believed that Trump was merely referring to Todd\\\\u2019s appearance.\\\\nMany have jumped to the president\\\\u2019s defense. While many are sympathizing with him, there are also critics who believe that this matter is being blown out of proportion.\\\\nSocial media is divided over this issue. There are those who don\\\\u2019t think Trump even knew the history of this term.\\\\nSome also say that it\\\\u2019s highly unlikely that the POTUS picked it up from any of his associates. Trump probably just came up with a moniker for Todd and ran with it, as he\\\\u2019s prone to do.\\\\nSome have also tried to defend the Prez with facts. His supporters claim that Trump\\\\u2019s critics have cited Nazi party member Julius Streicher children\\\\u2019s book, Der Giftpilz (The Poisonous Mushroom).\\\\nAccording to Calvin College\\\\u2019s German Propaganda Archive, the book was published by Streicher to promote anti-Semitic propaganda in Nazi Germany and even taught to children in schools.\\\\nConservatives argue that the \\\\u201cwary and piercing\\\\u201d eyes quote was mistranslated or misinterpreted to back up the \\\\u201csleepy eyes\\\\u201d claim. While that may be possible, Streicher\\\\u2019s book is not the only source of the Jewish physical stereotype. There are also Neo-Nazi groups that follow the \\\\u201csleepy eyes\\\\u201d stereotype.\\\\nNonetheless, it\\\\u2019s highly unlikely President Trump had any anti-Semitic intent behind his peculiar nickname for Todd.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s probable that we\\\\u2019re reading too much into Trump\\\\u2019s habit for name-calling. For one, even Todd himself is unfettered by the nickname!\\\\nThe NBC journalist was once asked about Trump\\\\u2019s nickname for him.\\\\nPeter Kenez explained that there are a lot more common Jewish stereotypes in Nazi propaganda. \\\\u201cSleepy eyes\\\\u201d was not something every German knew and was hardly a major feature of their anti-Semitic propaganda to cause an uproar.\"}\\n',\n",

Nevertheless, more just recently things altered and BMW essentially verified the M8 will be based upon the 8 Series which will be the coupe variation of the 7 Series. This came as a shock for numerous however it made substantially more sense than using an i8-based M car. Thanks to that, the brand-new M8 can be considered as the spiritual follower to the initial 8 Series, a high efficiency high-end coupe from the \\\\u201990s.\\\\nMuch like with its predecessor, the production M8 is a two-door high-end coupe however there is a lot more to it than simply that. For beginners, the car is now based upon BMW\\\\u2019s all brand-new CLAR architecture which debuted with the brand-new 7 Series. This permits the huge coupe to be fairly light for its size.\\\\nOn top of that, the platform provides it an extremely stiff chassis which was not possible in the past. This will enable it to use terrific NVH levels and likewise an actually excellent set of driving attributes. The latter will be enhanced with the assistance of its running equipment.\\\\nIt looks like the 2019 BMW M8 may include a totally adaptive suspension system which is otherwise not available on the 7 Series. This would respond to the roadway ahead and it would prepare the car for the next corner ahead of time.\\\\nThis system has actually been attempted prior to however up until now it wasn\\\\u2019t actually all that great. The one that will be set up on the 2019 M8 ought to enable it to be substantially faster than its smaller sized brother or sisters while likewise being much heavier.\\\\nThe upcoming BMW M8 will most likely turn into one of the most pricey BMW lorries ever.

The sales will begin in the fall of the next year.\\\\nAlthough the production model has yet to be exposed, the car was seen checking a while earlier. On top of that, the GTE Le Mans racer provides us a respectable concept about exactly what to anticipate.\\\\nFrom the appearances of it, the brand-new M8 will be a fair bit longer, broader and lower than the comparable 6 Series.

We were the first clinic in South Africa to receive the Dermapen 4. So what makes the Dermapen 4 so much better than the Dermapen 3 or any other microneedling device?\\\\nDermapen 4 has a 16 needle cartridge instead of just 12 needles, reaching an inflammatory response at a much quicker rate.\\\\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 47.9% more micro-channels than Dermapen 3 and 104% more micro-channels than any counterfeit device.\\\\nThe Dermapen 4 generates 1,920 puncture channels per second, which means we can almost double the amount of serums and actives that we needle into the skin per treatment, than before.\\\\nThe additional 620 micro-channels makes the treatment much quicker and more comfortable than before.\\\\nDermapen 4 is the only microneedling device with a dedicated scar setting and protocols for revision of deep, atrophic scars; including surgical, burn contracture, striae and post-acne scars. Needle penetration can now be increased up to 3.0mm.\\\\nAOVN technology, automatically calibrates the motor speed, pressure and penetration for targeted precision.\\\\nThe Dermapen 4 is safer than other microneedling devices, no dragging or pulling of the skin.\\\\nOnly Dermapen 4 features a unique, medical-grade silicone seal and fluid guard. The external cartridge is fortified with a specialised fluid guard that prevents cross contamination to the outer cartridge shell. Safety First!\\\\nSpecialised retention valves relieve the build-up of procedural pressure within the Dermapen 4 needle cartridge. The effect prevents fluid build-up within the needle cavity. The vacuum-like sensation removes the risk of cross contamination whilst ensuring pressure-free contact to the skin during a procedure.\\\\nTop: Medical grade numbing cream applied for 20 \\\\u2013 30 minutes, we then needle medical grade serums and actives into the skin via the Dermapen 4 device. Bottom: An Alginate Mask is applied and connected to our IonZyme Machine. A medical grade concealer is applied to speed up recovery and cover any immediate post treatment redness.\\\\nThe Dermapen is an award winning micro-needling device.\\\\nWe use the Dermapen 4 to create safe pathways to deliver quality anti-aging serums deep into the skin.\\\\nNew collagen and elastin are now being produced by the body; tightening the skin and healing scars, fine lines and literally keeping the skin young and full of volume.\\\\nWhat is the Dermapen 4 good for?\\\\nSkin conditions: Treat pigmentation, skin texture, oily skin, acne and sun damaged skin.\\\\nThe numbing cream that we apply is a 30% Lidocaine medical-grade numbing cream that is only available at medical practices. Should your skincare \\\\u201cclinic\\\\u201d, not have an overseeing doctor, chances are that you are not receiving the appropriate numbing cream (only a 2% Lidocaine), which can make this treatment uncomfortable.\\\\nThe concentrated actives in the mask are delivered into the skin immediately after a microneedling treatment to instantly cool and soothe the skin and to improve the skins health complexion.\\\\nThe IonZyme machine introduces the use of Pulsed Iontophoresis; the use of a specifically pulsed electrical current to facilitate penetration of vitamins into the cells.\\\\nImmediately post this microneedling treatment, we apply an Alginate mask over the face. We then connected it to our IonZyme Machine to send an electrical current via the mask. This reduces inflammation to speed up recovery. The mask itself is infused with skin corrective peptides and anti-inflammatory actives which makes it the perfect compliment for the skin after a Dermapen treatment.\\\\nNatural Aesthetics is not a spa of \\\\u201cbeauty salon\\\\u201d; we are a medical practice.\\\\nOur Therapists are specially trained to administer medical microneedling and IonZyme Machine treatments safely and correctly.\\\\nEach of our Therapists have also received special training by Dr Wade Merchant to further ensure that our patients receive the safest and most effective treatments.\\\\nFor the month of April only: Receive a Face & Neck Dermapen 4 Treatment + An Alginate Mask + IonZyme Machine Treatment for only R1,500 (all inclusive).\\\\nOR call us on 021 433 0967.\"}\\n',\n",

Indians are mandated by the government to have Aadhar card and ration cards as this serves as a means of identification proving that they are citizens of India. Aside this, other reasons for this mandate include account opening, LG connections, among others.\\\\nThe rations cards are likewise necessary for citizens to have too. This post entails how Aadhar card can be linked to ration cards. This is in an approach taken by the government, being security conscious, to ensure that the citizens do not fall victims of the very many scams nowadays.\\\\nRation cards started as what each household must have to get issuance of food grains, fuels and other rates that have been subsidized by the government.

The result, after 1 year: big savings.\\\\nMy energy company (and your\\\\u2019s probably will too) gives me a side-by-side comparison of how many kWh of electricity I used in the current month and to the current month one year ago.\\\\nThe best part is that I\\\\u2019ve noticed a trend. My energy bills are significantly less each month this year than they were in the same month last year \\\\u2014 especially as the temperature starts to rise.\\\\nWhat Makes Programmable Thermostats So Great?\\\\nProgrammable thermostats give you the ability to designate pre-programmed temperature changes in your home.\\\\nWon\\\\u2019t your home be sweltering if you even increase its temperature during the day by a measly 2 degrees in the summer?\\\\nWell, yes\\\\u2026 or no. It won\\\\u2019t matter if you work a regular 9-to-5 job and no one is home during the day, but what if you have an irregular schedule due to working from home, having a swing shift, being a stay at home mom, etc? More on that later.\\\\n7 Day Schedule \\\\u2013 This allows you this most flexibility in your settings. With this feature (instead of the 5+2 or 5+1+1 schedule options) you can set all weekdays together with different weekend setting OR you can set each day to it\\\\u2019s own program (works well if you have an irregular schedule and work from home, like I do).\\\\nTemporary AND Vacation Hold \\\\u2013 Temporary hold allows you to override the pre-programmed setting for a short period of time. The \\\\u201chold\\\\u201d will be canceled at the next pre-set cycle. Vacation hold allows you to suspend your current settings and implement a different, more efficient temperature setting while you\\\\u2019re away for a few days. Best of all, your home will be back to normal on the day you return. Sweet huh?\\\\nBackup Battery Power \\\\u2013 It\\\\u2019s a good idea to have this feature so that in the event of a power failure, you will not have to reprogram your thermostat.\\\\nFor my home and specific HVAC system, I chose the Hunter 7-day programmable thermostat.\\\\nIt has all the above mentioned features plus some other handy features. Perhaps one of my favorite additional features it has is an air filter monitor that reminds me when it\\\\u2019s time to change the filter. This is vitally important to efficient heating and cooling!\\\\nTwo of the most prominent manufacturers of programmable thermostats are Honeywell and Hunter.\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t make the mistake that I made and cost yourself more time and money.\\\\nBefore installing your new programmable thermostat, shut off the power to your unit by flipping the breaker at BOTH your fuse box and indoor portion of your HVAC unit.\\\\nIf you do that, you can install your new programmable thermostat in about 30 minutes.\\\\nHave you ever had a programmable thermostat in your home?

Don\\\\u2019t just throw in the towel on your dream and pick up a dead end job, lets start turning a profit together.\\\\nI have created a list of the most common ways to make money on a homestead. I have personally done, or currently do, everything that is on this list and can tell you it works. Hopefully it will get your mind working and you can think of something that you can do to turn a profit.\\\\nIf you have a few minutes a day, you can grow some extra produce and sell for a profit. Depending on where you live, you can sell produce at a farmers market or even just set up a stand in front of your house. We have had great success selling produce in from of our house, trusting that people will be honest and leave the money they owe.\\\\nDid you know that you can easily sell Japanese Maple seedlings for between $2 and $3 a piece. My husband purchased a bundle of seeds on eBay one year claiming it would make us rich and I thought he was nuts. Eight months later, he sold 500 seedlings, at $2.50 a piece, to a local bonsai farm that needed stock!\\\\nAnother great thing about trees is that they continue to grow, and increase in value, if they don\\\\u2019t sell.\\\\nEveryone has to purchase seeds when they get started, there is no way around that. Once you are established and can sustain what you need for seeds, you should have an abundance of extras you can sell.\\\\nWhether you raise chickens, ducks, emus, or quale, people are always interested in naturally produced eggs. He sell our eggs on a farm stand in front of our house and they sell as fast as we can get them out there. We actually have reason to believe that our neighbors are tracking what time we restock the stand and come empty us out before anyone else can!\\\\nThe demand for naturally produced eggs has skyrocketed and so has the demand for backyard chickens. Hatch a few extra chicks this spring and try and sell them to people looking to get started. If they don\\\\u2019t sell as chicks, you can easily sell them as hens that are already producing. People are always willing to spend a little extra money so they don\\\\u2019t have to wait!\\\\nIf you have large backyard animals at your homestead, breed them and sell the babies! This is the single highest source of profit on our homestead and it can easily be on yours too. All you need is a little space and time and you can start to make money on your homestead today.\\\\nWhether you have cows or goats, people are always looking for healthy milk to feed their family. They are willing to pay a little extra to purchase that milk from someone they know than from the commercial production farms.\\\\nIf you are producing milk on your homestead, you should be producing cheese as well. Cheese is a great way to make money on your homestead with just a little extra effort.\\\\nIt is harder to grow just enough herbs for your family than it is to grow enough to sell! If you have ever grown herbs, then you know what I mean! Dry the extra\\\\u2019s and sell them to people that don\\\\u2019t want to grow their own. This is another hot product that sells quickly on your farm stand.\\\\nOrganic beef jerky is a very popular product right now, and it is very simple to make. Take advantage of the craze and learn how to make it now!\\\\nIf you grow extra produce and can them, it will fly off the shelves all winter. People that didn\\\\u2019t prepared themselves as well as you did will be very happy to purchase the products from you instead of the big bad grocery store. In other words, you will be making money off people that didn\\\\u2019t prepare as well as you did.\\\\nJam is another great product you can sell in your farm stand. It is very simple to make and store, and people love it. This is another one of our top sellers!\\\\nIf you have maple trees on your land, you should be tapping them and selling the syrup. There is no logical reason not to, so don\\\\u2019t let them go to waste.\\\\nDehydrate the foods that you grew too much of and sell what you don\\\\u2019t need. It\\\\u2019s just going to take up space anyways, you might as well make some money off it.\\\\nIf people know that baked goods are freshly made from scratch, they will be glad to buy them from you. If baking is your thing, you should take advantage of this money maker!\\\\nMost homesteads have an abundance of trees and the need to clear out new grazing areas. Go ahead and clear that lot, then cut up to logs to sell. Selling cord wood is one of the most common sources of income for homesteads.\\\\nEveryone has to start somewhere, and people are usually willing so they can learn from your mistakes. Figure out which homesteading skills you have mastered and offer classes to others that might need help in those areas. This is another one of the most common ways to make money on your homestead.\\\\nI wont tell you that a homesteading blog is going to make you rich, but it can help make a little extra money while sharing experience with others. I will also admit that I have learned just as much as I have taught others though this blog.\\\\nDo you have something to add to the discussion? Please let me know in the comment field below!\\\\nSome great ideas! I know a lot of people that sell the produce from their homestead, but offering classes and selling dehydrated food are great ideas. The market for dehydrated food is on the increase \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s great for hikers, campers, cyclists, travellers. And, it\\\\u2019s so expensive to buy from the camping stores. I definitely think this is a top idea.\\\\nThanks Kelly, I have only bee selling dehydrated food for a few months now but it is a huge seller. It is also very easy to do, so it totally makes sense!\\\\nAngela, It\\\\u2019s good to see other ladies that are having success with a few of these methods for making money as well. I highly suggest you try selling your eggs too if you have chickens. You are already collecting the eggs, you might as well sell them! Thanks for the share!\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Despite covering nearly three quarters of the surface of the earth, the world\\\\u2019s oceans are signalling a severe deterioration in health due to a number of human related impacts. An independent set of report published by the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO) has indicated that various significant factors are mounting a cause for concern that is overreaching what scientists had initially predicted.\\\\nOver time, the ocean has lessoned the affects of global warming by absorbing excess CO2 from the atmosphere. Whilst this has reduced greenhouse gas levels, this uptake of carbon dioxide has caused the water to become increasingly acidic. Along with overfishing, other sources of pollution and the increasingly more common \\\\u2018dead zones\\\\u2019 formed by fertiliser run-off, the oceans are showing the strains and may suffer from potential mass extinction.\\\\nAn example of where these negative impacts are being noticeably felt are along coral reefs. Not only are the corals incredibly sensitive to ocean warming but pollution, coral mining and destructive fishing practices also limit the growth of these vital organisms negatively impacting their vital role in biological ecosystems and geochemical processes within the sea. A recent report revealed that coral coverage on the Great Barrier Reef, the world\\\\u2019s largest coral system, has declined by a staggering 50% over the past 30 years.\\\\nThe reports indicate the requirement for immediate responses on both a global, national and local scale. Chiefly, urgent action must be taken to cut CO2 emissions, promote and manage sustainable fishing practices and governments must tackle key groups of chemicals that are being released into the ocean.\\\\nPlease watch the following three sort films and answer the questions below. Your answers need to be posted at the bottom of this blog.\\\\nWhat is the main ocean threat discussed in each video?\\\\n\\\\u0097What actions are people taking to address these threats?\\\\nFilm 3: Arabian \\\\u2018Sea Cows\\\\u2019 Going Hungry?\\\\nIn video 1, the main threats are pollution, global warming and over-fishing. People are trying to help by making coral reefs out of man-made, artificial objects. In the second video, the problem was that they were using dynamite to fish and it was damaging the coral reefs. And same as before, they were over-fishing. They introduced a few new rules including putting 10% of the land as no fishing zones. In the final video, the threats to the dugongs were motor boats and fishing nets. The government banned some types of fishing nets and produced new laws on the speed limit of a speed boat.\\\\nThe main ocean threats in video one is the impact that global warming and pollution is making on the coral reefs/animals. Humans are polluting the ocean by throwing wastes in it and some marine animals had mistaken it for food which causes them to choke and die but others have been trying to restore the corals by creating artificial ones from shipwrecks and man made things although this can only be temporarily.\\\\nIn video 2, the main threats is the destruction on the coral reefs and the rapid decrease of fish from using dynamites,cyanides and over fishing. To fix this problem, the government created a law banning destructive fishing but since that didnt work, a man called Angel Alcala introduced the villagers to a new strategy of creating a \\\\u2018no fishing\\\\u2019 zone which restored the fishes within three years. The villagers then created two new rules: Fishing only allowed for Abo villager & no destructive fishing methods.\\\\nIn video three, they are talking about the threats to the dugongs and the sea grass beds. Pollution from the construction of houses goes into the ocean killing the sea grasses which then affects the food chain since most marine life that live there depend on it especially the dugongs. Other than that, dugongs are found washed ashore, stuck in fishing nets while others aree killed by speedboats. So the government decided to create a marine/dugong protected sanctuary and banned certain types of fishing nets.\\\\nIn video 1, the main threats were global warming, pollutions and overfishing. Global warming and pollutions are destroying the coral reefs and animals under the sea. Humans are also making pollution and destroying the ocean by throwing rubbish into the ocean. The fishes in the ocean doesn\\\\u2019t know so they eat it and they are going to die faster. In the future we might not be able to see beautiful fishes in the oceans anymore.\\\\nIn video 2, the main threats were destruction on the coral reefs and using dynamites, cyanides and also overfishing. The government decided to make a law to ban destructive fishing. But it did not help the villagers. So a man called Angel Alcala showed the villagers and told them to make a no fishing zone. The villagers created 2 new rules that they made up which was fishing allowed for Abo villagers and no destructive fishing methods. The villagers said that it had change their life from doing this.\\\\nIn video 3, they were talking about the dugongs and sea beds. Pollutions affect the sea beds and then the dugongs because the dugongs eat sea beds as their main food. When the Dugongs die they will normally found on the shore. The scientist were investigating about it. That said that some were stuck in fishing nets while others are killed because of speedboats these days. The government decided to protect the dugongs and banned some types of fishing nets.\\\\nThe main threat in video 1 is global warming, pollution and overfishing. Nowadays many people throw waste into the sea and marine animals mistaken it for food, this would make the animals eat the waste and choke. Pollution and global warming is destroying a huge number of coral reef under the sea which makes feeding grounds less for a variety of aquatic life. Nowadays people have been trying to make artificial reefs that are made by man-made objects and sunken ships to increase the number of feeding ground for the aquatic life.\\\\nThe main threat in video 2 is destructive fishing method by using dynamite and cyanide as well as over fishing to catch fishes and does also destroy the coral reefs. The government created a law banning destructive fishing, but the law was not enforceable. Then a man called Angel Alcala help the villagers about this case by introducing a \\\\u2018Non Fishing Zone\\\\u2019 which unbelievably restored back the amount of fish in three years time. Then the Apo Islanders came up with two new rules but still continued the rule of \\\\u2018Non Fishing Zone\\\\u2019 in the sanctuary. Rule number one is that fishing there is only for Apo Islanders. Rule number two is that no destructive fishing method were allowed.\\\\nThe main threat in video 3 is pollution from construction which destroy and dugongs and the seagrass bed. Dugongs is a large marine mammal which eats grass from the seagrass bed. Dugongs need seagrass to survive as well as green turtles which the seagrass bed provides food and shelter for it. Dugongs are also found washed up ashore because of speedboats or had been captured into the fishing nets and drown when they become tangled with nets. Government decided make up a law reducing the boat speed in some areas and also banned some certain types of fishing nets.\\\\nIn video 1 the main reasons are that people are fishing too much, pollution and global warming. Some people are trying too help the oceans by making coral reefs with man made objects. In the second video they also fished too much but they were using explosives to fish which damaged the coral reefs which leads to less fish in the oceans. In the final video the boats where threatening the seas with the speed of the boat also the mortar boat and fishing boats where damaging the seas so that less and less fish where in the reefs and oceans.\\\\nThe threat discussed in this video are pollution (plastic bags), global warming and over fishing which destroyed the reefs.\\\\nAn action people is taking to address these threats are that they make artificial (fake) coral reefs.\\\\nThe threat discussed in this video is that the number of fish decreased very quickly because of destructive fishing (using dynamites and cyanide). The coral reefs were destroyed.\\\\nThe actions people are taking to address this threat are they set up no fishing zone (fishing sanctuary). They also made rules that fishing is for only Apo Islanders and no destructive fishing methods.\\\\nThe threat discussed in this video is that the pollution and silt covered and killed the sea grass. Sea cows and other marine animals have less food.\\\\nThe actions people are taking to address this threat is they count how many sea cows they have. And when they find a dead sea cow on the beach, they measure its size and took photos and try to find out how it died. They set up a sanctuary for sea cows. They reduce boat speeds and ban fishing nets that harm the sea cows. They also teach the children how important the sea cows are.\\\\nToday, Global warming,over-fishing and pollution are the main cause of ocean health deterioration.\\\\nAll videos explain in detail the impacts of these human-related factors in ocean reef.\\\\nEventhough in some area they have tried to reverse the deterioration of reef life,unfortunately most part is irreversible.\\\\nSome marine scientists had come up with idea of \\\\u201cfishing zone\\\\u2019 to restore to some extend the life of fish in some villages, but it damage from industries, human and chemical waste and other are so extensive that require immediate responses in national and global scale.\\\\nOur response should focus on area of conservation, public awareness and education.\\\\nIn the first video the main threat in pollution and global warming, people start to throw rubbish into the sea, which it\\\\u2019s starting to destroy the coral reefs under the sea. Small and big fishes in the sea eats the rubbish that is been thrown into the sea which will eventually lead them to die faster.\\\\nIn the second video it shows how quick fish decreased in the sea because of destructive fishing using dynamites and cynides. Which made the govourments decide to ban destructive fishing. But it didn\\\\u2019t help the villagers. So one day a man called Angel Alcala told the villagers to set up a zone called no fishing zone. So they made up two new rules which allows the villagers to fish without using the method destructive fishing. And so it changes their life forever.\\\\nIn the third video it shows sea beds and gugongs. Pollution will eventually destroy the sea bed that the dugongs eat as their food everyday. Most of the dugongs die because they have no food and some fishing nets most of them will be found on the beach shore. The scientists said some dugongs are being killed by nets while some other are being killed some speedboats. So the govourments tries to protect the dugongs by banning some of the fishing nets.\\\\nthe main threats are overfishing, global warming and pollution. People are trying to stop this by creating artificial(fake) coral reefs as fishes are dying a lot.\\\\nVideo 2: In this video they showed how quickly fish are decreasing by the way of using dynamites and cynides. The government tried to ban destructive fishing but it didn\\\\u2019t work. so some guy set up a no fishing zone.\\\\nIn this video the threats were speed boats going too fast and some fishing nets were causing too much damage. So a speed limit was set and some nets banned.\\\\nIn video 1 the main threats were overfishing, pollution and global warming people are trying to solve the problem using man made artificial coral reefs the other problems are rubbish and fish eating plastic.\\\\nIn video 2 they showed how quickly the population on fish decreased by using harmful fishing methods including dynamite and cynides which destroyed coral reefs, the government tried to ban this type of fishing but it didn\\\\u2019t work so a guy called Angel Alcala talked them into a non fishing zones and setting up a marine life sancuary, the villagers were enthusiastic and 10 percent of the island were non fishing zones or marine life sanctuarys. They banned destructive fishing and everything was normal.\\\\nThe third video the threat is pollution destroying the seagrass bed which affects a lot of marine life especially the sea cow. They were also affected by speed boats and getting tangled in nets, so to save the species the government reduced the speed limits of boats and banned harmful types of nets.\\\\nThe main threats are global warming,pollution and over fishing. People are helping by using artificial reefs created by sunken ships or other man made objects.\\\\nThe main threats in this video were fishermen using destructive fishing method which decreases the population of fish and damaged the coral habitats. Because of that they used 10% of the land and made it a no fishing zone.\\\\nThe main threat in this video are constructions polluting the ocean, choking the corals and smothering the sea grass. Also the speed boats were too fast and the fishing nets caused too much damage which affects the marine lives especially the dugongs(sea cow). Because of this they had to reduce the speed of boats and banned harmful types of nets.\\\\nIn the first film, the main threats are pollution, overfishing and global warming. So the people make artificial reefs.\\\\nThe second film\\\\u2019s threat is that people use explosives to kill fish. The people then made a no fishing zone.\\\\nThis last film\\\\u2019s threat was construction polluting the sea bed. The people then had boat speed limits and banned some nets.\\\\nFilm 1: The great threats in the video is global warming (sometimes caused by pollution) and overfishing. What people do to help is make artificial coral reefs out of man made objects like a sunken ship to replace the reefs destroyed.\\\\nFilm 2 : The huge threats to the ocean in this video is fishermen that use effective methods in fishing for example throwing explosives into the water. Then one guy suggested a way of reducing it by banning throwing explosives to kill the fishes and made a non fishing zone.\\\\nFilm 3: The big threat in this video is that pollution will soon destroy the sea grass and the dugongs (sea cows) only feed on sea grass. They were affected by the speed of boats on the water surface and fishing nets. The people banned the use of some kinds of nets and had a speed limit for the boats.\\\\nIn the first video, the main threat was pollution in the ocean. Some groups of people are trying to protect and make artificial coral reefs.\\\\nIn the second video, the main threat was explosions being used to catch fishes. The method works but it would also destroy the coral reefs. Then, people started to build a sanctuary for fishes.\\\\nIn the third video, the main threat was fishing boats going too fast and some fishing nets were causing too much damage. A speed limit was set to prevent more damages.\\\\nThe main threats in the video is global warming and pollution. Humans are finding a way to help by using man made objects and artificial reefs.\\\\nThe main threats in this video is humans are using explosions to catch fishes, and it shows how fast the fish are decreasing. Which damages the corals habitats.\\\\nThe main threats in this video is pollution and destroying the sea grass beds which affects the sea cows. The speed boats are going too fast, so they set a speed limit.\\\\nCoral reefs in the first video provide a habitat for many different kinds of fish. They had lived and reproduced for 50 million years, but in these days people throw rubbish, such as plastic bags and cans into the ocean. This causes pollution, which is one of the main threats. Two other threats in the first video are global warming, andover fishing. People are creating artificial reefs by using sunken ships and man-made objects to replace the real reefs, but these artificial reefs can only stay for a while.\\\\nFish in the Apo Island in Philippines are decreasing rapidly. Fishermen are trying as hard as they could to find fish, but sometimes they only get a few small fish\\\\u2026\\\\u2026.\\\\nThe main threats in the second video are using dynamites and cyanide to fish (these can also destroy coral reefs). Another main problem on the Apo Island is over fishing. The government had considered and decided to ban destructive fishing, but the law did not help. In 1980, a doctor called Angel Alcala suggested that they could make a \\\\u2018no fishing zone\\\\u2019 where they were not allowed to find fish, and the outcome was quite impressive.\\\\nSea grass, in the third video, are food for dugongs. In order to survive, dugongs need to eat huge amount of sea grass, but they are dying because of pollution from construction of buildings and houses. Not only dugongs that suffer, but sea grass also provide food for green tortoise. There may not be any dugong left if they suffer longer. The government protected dugongs by banning some types of fishing and reduced speed boats.\\\\nIn video one the main threat is that there is global warming, pollution and over fishing. People are now making artificial reefs from sunken ships and other man-made objects but the ocean is still in threat from this problem.\\\\nIn video two the main threat is that people are using dynamites and cyanides to fish and it was very good for fishing but it was bad for the coral habitat. A man called Angel Alcala told the villagers to ban fishing in some areas. They made 2 rules that only Apo island villagers are allowed to fish and they are not allowed to use destructive fishing methods.\\\\nIn video three the main threat is that the constructions is polluting the ocean which is choking the corals and sea grass that the dugongs eat so they are dying. They are also killed by the boats and they drown from getting tangled in the fishing nets. To fix this problem the government banned certain types of fishing nets and reduced the boat speed.\\\\nIn the first clip, the main threat in coral reefs is pollution, global warming and over fishing. To help the coral reefs, people nowadays try to help by making coral reefs out of man-made objects.\\\\nThe main threat in the second clip is destructive fishing method by using dynamite and cyanide. To help preventing from this happening, the law is now banning destructive fishing, but it didn\\\\u2019t work out, so someone named Mr. Angel Alcala was introduced with the idea of the \\\\u201cNo Fishing Zone\\\\u201d, which stunningly gained back more fishes in three years\\\\u2019 time.\\\\nThe first video gives us a general idea of humans polluting in various ways and at the same time, not realizing the destruction we made to the marine life. Although scientists invented artificial reefs, I think that the main factor is us.\\\\nThe second video focuses on Apo Islands in the Philippines where decades ago, the fishing village faced marine life problems hence their use of destructive fishing. Many years later, they became more aware of a healthy marine life so they made no-fishing areas. They went through the obstacles and now finds themselves successful.\\\\nThe third video explains to us that another cause of decreasing marine life is because of fishing boats traveling too fast, whereas the net happens to be the problem. The resolution to that problem is a speed limit in seas. And it\\\\u2019s strange.\\\\nIn conclusion, all of the videos are about humans threat to the sea but most of us are unaware of what we are doing. In my opinion, I think that the best resolution is to discuss them in communities to make people more aware because lots\\\\u00d7small changes=BIG change.\\\\nFirst video: The main threats of this video are global warming, pollutions and overfishing which destroys coral reefs and many species of fishes. People also throw rubbish into the sea that fishes think that they are food and eat them. This makes fishes die. Pollution and rubbish are destroying coral reefs more and more everyday. Humans are making artificial reefs from sunken ships and other objects to try to replace the real reefs.\\\\ndecreasing because of fisher men using destructive fishing methods. The government tried to ban destructive fishing but it didn\\\\u2019t work so Angel Alcala banned some area to not do fishing and made some no fishing zone. Also he made a rule to have no more destructive fishing and this made fishes increase although it took them a long time it still worked.\\\\nand he had banned some type of fishing nets.\\\\nIn film one, the main ocean threats are people over fishing, global warming and pollution which was caused by people throwing rubbish into the sea. Some marine animals also mistook it for food and ate it which made them die faster. Groups of people who are trying to help made artificial coral reefs out of man-made objects.\\\\nIn film two, the main threats are people over fishing and also using destructive fishing methods such as using dynamites and cyanide. This decreased the population of fishes and also destroyed coral reefs. A man named Mr. Angel Alcala banned some places from fishing and had more no fishing zones. After that, people came up of two rules for fishing, only Apo islanders are able to do fishing and no destructive fishing methods were allowed.\\\\nIn film three, the main threats are constructions polluting the ocean, choking the choral reefs and destroying the sea grass which would be eaten by the dugongs (sea cows). Many things were effecting the dugongs such as fishing boats were also going too fast and they were tangled in fishing nets. People fixed the problems by banning some types of fishing nets that would make more injuries to the dugongs and there were speed limits for fishing boats.\\\\nThe main problems are pollution, global warming and overfishing in some areas. This causes destruction of the coral reef and therefore causes coral species to be endangered. Also fish confuses trash for food and eat them killing them. Their solution for the problems are making artificial reefs.\\\\nThe problem discussed in this video is destructive fishing, for example using Cyanide or dynamite to fish. The negative effect from destructive fishing caused the coral reef to die therefore decreasing the chance of a fisherman catching fishes. The problem was solved by making part of the reef a \\\\u2018marine sanctuary\\\\u2019 or a place where no fishing is allowed. The island\\\\u2019s fishery was restored within 10 years.\\\\nThe problem was declining dugong (sea cow) population. This is caused by pollution and debris falling on the sea grass which is the dugong\\\\u2019s food supply. Also fishing nets and boats are killing dugongs. The government decided to ban certain types of fishing nets and limit boat speeds.\\\\nIn the first video clip, there\\\\u2019s 3 main threats; global warming, pollution and over-fishing. People are now making coral reefs with man-made, artificial objects such as from sunken ships.\\\\nIn the second video, the main threats are harmful ways to catch fish, and once again, over fishing. A man by the name of Angel Alcala tells the villagers to make no fishing zone, which within 3 years, the fishes were once again restored. Two new rules were also created: Fishing is only allowed for the villagers in Abo Island and no destructive fishing methods.\\\\nThe third video is now about dugongs and sea beds. Pollution affects the sea beds which is the dugongs main source of food. Some then end up in the shore and are trapped with fishing nets, or killed by motorboats. The government then decided to ban certain types of fishing nets and set a speed limit for the boats.\\\\nThe main threats in this video are pollution, global warming and over-fishing. This harms coral reefs and causes many species of fish to become endangered or extinct. Fish also eat the trash we throw into the sea when they mistake them for food. People now use man-made objects to make artificial reefs.\\\\nThis video explores destructive fishing methods in an island called Apo island. These fishing methods include using dynamite and cyanide. The methods made the coral reefs die. The solution to this problem was to make a \\\\u201cmarine sanctuary\\\\u201d which is a zone where fishing was banned. Later they changed the rules so that only Apo fishermen were allowed to fish there and so no one used destructive fishing methods there anymore. The coral reef was then restored 10 years later.\\\\nThe problem in this video is the diminishing dugong population.Dugongs are nicknamed as the \\\\u201csea cow\\\\u201d. This is because all they do all day is eat sea grass.\\\\nQ 1. the problem they talked about is about pollution, global worming and over fishing all of which destroys the coral reefs which are the home to many fishes.\\\\nQ 2. They made new reefs from man-made materials for the fishes to live in.\\\\nQ 2. They stop using violent methods to fish and recede to using their original tribal methods. They also arrange an area which they called the \\\\u201cfish Sanctuary\\\\u201d in which they stop all fishing activity and allows the corals and fish to grow. Finally the fish will spread out of that area and their will be more fishes.\\\\nQ 1. The main threat is the pollution from boats which then drops down to the ocean floor and stop the grass on the sea bed from flourishing and therefore, there is less food for the dugongs and the green turtles. They also talk about fishing nets which kills the dugongs.\\\\nQ 2. They banned some types of fishing nets and they decrease the speed limit for the boats. They also set up some education for the kids to study about the dugongs.\\\\nVideo 1: The three main threats are over fishing, pollution and global warming. To stop these threats the people are making artificial coral reefs usually made from sunken old ships and old metal things.\\\\nVideo 3: The Main threats of this video is pollution destroying the sea bed witch is the dugongs foods.\\\\nThe government bands some typed of fishing nets and setting a speed limit for boats.\\\\nVideo 1: the main threat is pollution, over fishing and global warming which is destroying the coral reefs.\\\\nThey tried to solve this by building artificial reefs from sunken ships and other man made things.\\\\nVideo 2: the main threat is caused by the explosive method fishermens are using to fish.\\\\nThe villagers fixed this problem by turning one section of the island to a no fishing zone for three years which made the area recover massively.\\\\nVideo 3: the main threat is the decreasing amount of sea grass beds which is serving as the main food for dugongs or sea cows.\\\\nThe government is trying to solve this problem by banning some types kf fishing nets and speedboats which are killing the dugongs.\\\\nIn the first video, the main threats are pollution, over fishing and global warming which harm the coral reefs and fish. People are trying to stop this by using man-made materials to make coral.\\\\nThe main threats in the second video are people using dynamite and cyanide to fish fish which also destroys the coral. People have made a \\\\u2018fish sanctuary\\\\u2019 where the fish and coral can grow peacefully because you are not allowed to fish there and eventually the fish will spread out and people have stopped using dynamite and cyanide to to fish.\\\\nIn video 3, the main threat is from the pollution of the boats which go down to the sea bed and kills it which means that the dugongs and turtles will have very little to eat. People have decreesed the speed limit for the boats so there will be more food for the dugongs and the turtles.\\\\nIn the first video, the main threaths are pollution, global warming and over fishing which is destroying the coral reefs and fish. They are trying to stop this by using man made materials to make corals.\\\\nIn the second video, the main threaths are caused by fishermen using dynamite and cyanide to catch fish which also is destroying the corals. They solved this problem by not letting fishermen fish in one section of the island for three years. Now, fishermen had stop using dynamite and cyanide to fish.\\\\nIn the third video, the main threath is pollution from the boats that travel down the sea bed and kills the seagrass which means that the dugongs and the turtles won\\\\u2019t have much to eat. The solution is to decrease the speed limit of boats so the dugongs and the turtles will have enough food to eat.\\\\nIn the second video,The main threats . people using dynamite and cyanide to fish, which also destroys the coral. People have made a \\\\u2018fish sanctuary\\\\u2019 where the fish and coral can grow peacefully because you are not allowed to fish there and eventually the fish will spread out and people have stopped using dynamite and cyanide to to fish.\\\\nIn the third vedio, the main threat is from the pollution of the boats which go down to the sea bed and kills it which means that the dugongs and turtles will have very little to eat.They are also killed by the boats and they drown from getting tangled in the fishing nets.\\\\nThe main ocean threats are global warming, pollution and over fishing. Sea animals have mistaken it for food which causes them to choke and die. People are trying to make coral reefs out of man made, artificial objects to help them.\\\\nThe problem was people were using dynamites to fish but they are also damaging the coral reefs. They also banned places not fish.\\\\nThe final video are talking about the dugongs and sea beds. The pollution affect the sea beds and the dugongs next. This is because dugongs eat them as their main food.\\\\nIn video 1 the main threats are pollution global warming and overfishing. People are trying to create artificial coral reefs.\\\\nIn video 2 the people were using dynamites to fish. So some places were banned for fishing.\\\\nIn video 1 the threats are pollution and global warming . People are trying to manufacture artificial coral reefs.\\\\nIn video 1 the main ocean threats are global warming, pollution and over fishing, over fishing and global warming which harm the coral reefs and fish. People are trying to stop this by using man made materials to make coral.\\\\nThe final video are talking about the dugongs and sea beds. The pollution affect the sea beds and the dugongs next. The boats were causing damage so a speed limit was set.\\\\nIn the first video the main threats are global warming ,pollution and over fishing which harm the coral reefs and fishes. People are trying to stop this by using man made materials to make coral.\\\\nIn the second video the problem were people are using dynamites to fish but they are also destroying the coral reefs.So some places were banned for fishing.\\\\nIn the last video is about the pollution are damaging the sea bed so the government banned fishing using net and setting a speed limit for boat.\\\\nIn the 1st video the main threats are global warming, pollution and fishing.\\\\nIn the 2nd video the main threats are using dynamites to fish but also destroying the coral reef.\\\\nIn the 3rd video the main threats are about pollution damaging the sea.\\\\nIn the first section of video one, it talks about fishes and coral reefs. The second part of the video talks about how global warming, pollution and over fishing is a threat to fishes and coral reefs. Although some try to stop this by using man-made and artificial objects, the longness of this isn\\\\u2019t certain.\\\\nPeople are using explosive equipment like dynamites to catch fish, but not only is that a problem causing over fishing but it also ruins corals. So they decided to make a \\\\u2018fish sanctuary\\\\u2019 (a no fishing zone) so that the fish from there will eventually spread to other places too. Not only that, the corals will be able to grow without anything to harm them, now, there are people going snorkeling there because of the beautiful coral reefs and exotic sea creatures.\\\\nThis video talks about damaged sea beds which causes sea animals to starve, especially sea cows. The sea beds are being destroyed by speed boat going too fast.\\\\nSome of the sea cows are found dead on the beach so people take photos of it and get samples to try and find out how they died and why the population has gone down. Soon they found out that some of them died because they don\\\\u2019t have enough sea grass from the sea beds to eat and others died because they got caught in harmful nets.\\\\nThey try to prevent all these from happening by setting a speed limit to speed boats and banning fishing nets that is able to harm the sea cows.\\\\nIn the first video, the main threats are pollution, global warming and over fishing which harm the coral reefs. They are trying to stop this by making artificial coral reefs.\\\\nIn the 2nd video, the main threat is about using things like dynamite to fish, which also damage coral reefs. They tried to ban destructive fishing but it didn\\\\u2019t work so they decided to make NO FISHING ZONE and allows fish and coral reefs to grow.\\\\nIn the final video, the main threat is pollution from boat falling down to the sea beds, which are dugongs\\\\u2019s and green turtles\\\\u2019s food. Dugong also killed by fishing nets and and boats. The government banned some type of fishing nets and limit the speed.\"}\\n',\n",

But for victims of abuse it\\\\u2019s an around the clock problem, a constant specter hanging over everything they do.\\\\nThis is because of the expectation that abuse could occur at any time, an expectation that is best understood as basic anxiety, meaning the feeling of helplessness in a world perceived as hostile. If you\\\\u2019ve ever been really worried about something you know it didn\\\\u2019t matter whether the thing you were worried about came to pass, that time period filled with anxiety was extremely painful.\\\\nAbuse sets up a situation where victims are worried pretty much all the time. They\\\\u2019re constantly walking on eggshells, with no idea really of when the other shoe is going to drop. So yes, it\\\\u2019s the pain in the immediate moment caused by abusive actions that prompts their anxiety, but this anxiety extends far beyond the confines of the abusive situation to negatively affect all facets of life.\\\\nThis around the clock anxiety is likely to cause a cascade of detrimental effects, quite apart from the emotional and psychological fallout of concrete instances of abuse, effects like symptoms of PTSD and inhibition of thought and action. Victims take on global strategies for relating and being that have more to do with finding relief from anxiety than with striving to grow and self-actualize.\\\\nWe can see then that suffering through abuse is not just a tragedy because of the immediate emotional, psychological, or physical pain but on a deeper level because it changes personality and alters the life course, keeping people from becoming who and what they can be.\"}\\n',\n",

I lifted my blanket and put my left leg on the floor. I sleep on the left side of the bed, because the right side is nearer to the door and since Hillary is the one working irregular hours sometimes well into the night, we thought it might be better, if she took that side instead of having to walk all around the bed in the dark.\\\\nAs soon as my left foot hit the ground I froze. Something had changed. I could use my arms again. With no pain at all. I\\\\u2019m very happy about this.\\\\nOne of the doctors visited me today and we talked about my progress. My wound is healing well. I do have to go to the hospital soon to get an x-ray, so the doctors can see if everything inside is healing well too.\\\\nThe doctor told me I should start doing weight lifting exercises with small weights. I\\\\u2019m looking forward to it. I used to lift weights in high school. That is until I left the football team.\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve been doing a lot of reading lately. If you really like to read a good book, you should read Errol Flynn\\\\u2019s autobiography \\\\u201cMy Wicked, Wicked Ways\\\\u201d. I probably shouldn\\\\u2019t recommend it to you, but I\\\\u2019m not going to lie, it was probably one of the most amusing books I\\\\u2019ve ever read in my life.\\\\nWhen I was just a kid I loved adventure stories. At that time my favorite book was Alexandre Dumas\\\\u2019 \\\\u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo\\\\u201d. I read the original version of more than 1300 pages. I loved that book.

But organizations and individuals across the county are scrambling to identify projects to spend it, and the county commissioners have proposed a 14-member advisory council that would recommend projects over which the county commissioners would have final say.\\\\nThe county must hold a public workshop to discuss the ordinance to create the RESTORE council before it can be enacted into law. But already, the county is soliciting citizens to serve on the proposed council.\\\\nPam Shiver, the newly elected school board member set to be sworn in Tuesday, was appointed the school\\\\ufffds representative to the RESTORE committee at the Nov. 8 meeting.\\\\nThe cities, though, see things differently, and have invited the county to a Monday meeting to start a legal process to resolve the conflict. The county, based on the opinion of its attorney Michael Shuler, has opted not to become involved in the cities\\\\ufffd plan.\\\\nIn September, Apalachicola proposed distributing RESTORE funds between the cities and unincorporated areas of the county.\\\\nWhen the county failed to respond to the proposal, Apalachicola City Attorney Pat Floyd wrote to the county in October asking to enter into negotiations based on Chapter 164 of the Florida Statutes, which provides for creating a governmental conflict resolution procedure to provide an \\\\ufffdequitable, expeditious, effective, and inexpensive method\\\\ufffd to avoid courtroom squabbles between government entities.\\\\nShuler replied with a letter stating that no conflict existed between the cities and county because the distribution of RESTORE funds is mandated by federal law.\\\\nThe problem of who will allocate RESTORE funds within the counties is the subject of an ongoing debate. At the Oct. 16 county meeting, Commissioner Smokey Parrish, who acted as county liaison in matters related to the oil spill, said he would no longer represent the county in that capacity, after the commission voted 3-2 not to join the Gulf Consortium, a board proposed by the Florida Association of Counties (FAC) to vet and approve local projects funded by BP fines. Any future involvement by the county in the consortium could impact the decision-making powers of a local council.\\\\nAt the same meeting, commissioners voted to form the local council that would vet projects within the county but, under this plan, the county commission has the ultimate say in who receives funding.\\\\nThe RESTORE Act does not outline a process for what happens after money reaches Florida\\\\ufffds affected counties, but the FAC has suggested the creation of these RESTORE councils to decide where to spend the local funds, a suggestion echoed by Rep. Steve Southerland during a recent private meeting with some local officials.\\\\nFAC spokeswoman Cragin Mosteller said although counties are not required to form RESTORE committees, the FAC has recommended it to invoke transparency in the process.\\\\nAt their Nov. 1 meeting, Carrabelle commissioners voted unanimously to join Apalachicola in seeking talks with Franklin County over distribution of RESTORE Act funds.\\\\nBoth Apalachicola and Carrabelle have expressed displeasure with the county\\\\ufffds unwillingness to discuss the RESTORE Act.\\\\nHe said he believed the cities and the county have equal standing before the state as local entities eligible to receive RESTORE funds as \\\\ufffdcoastal political subdivisions,\\\\ufffd a term used in the RESTORE Act.\\\\nFloyd and Carrabelle City Attorney Dan Hartman agree. Hartman said the Florida League of Cities also maintains that municipalities are on equal footing with counties under RESTORE. Hartman wants the county to open a dialogue with the cities on the RESTORE Act Council proposed at the county\\\\ufffds Oct.16 meeting.\\\\nAt the Nov. 1 meeting, Carrabelle commissioner Brenda La Paz questioned whether demanding a dialogue would exclude the cities from participation in the proposed county RESTORE council. She asked if it would be possible to negotiate without going to court.\\\\nHartman told her Carrabelle could not be excluded from participation in the council and that statute 164 is designed to keep government disputes out of court. In a later interview, he said the cities could consider suing the county to force them to the table.\\\\nHartman said the case would be tried in the circuit court and the county could only avoid a court appearance by defaulting.\"}\\n',\n",

These moths devastate landscapes and ecosystems, because without the leaves, the trees they consume begin to die. Without trees, animals lose their homes, lumber businesses lose their \\\\\"crops\\\\\", for lack of a better term, and with few if any predators to eat them, the Gypsy moths rampantly destroy environments.\\\\nThe Gypsy moth males are the color of tree bark and are very hard to notice. The females are a stark white, and though they are easier to notice, they still cause immense amounts of damage before they are eradicated from an area.\\\\nThe American Moving and Storage Association has dedicated seminars on how to rid moving trucks and boxes of these bugs to help get their spreading under control. The moths tend to lay their eggs on the boxes and tend to live in damp places, like basements and attics.

However, trying to cure your thirst by drinking from a hose never feels like the most efficient way to solve the problem of thirst. When not properly controlled or directed, hoses tend to spray water all over \\\\u2013 wasting more on the ground than goes on the target.\\\\nThe same can be said for education reforms. Many educators in Georgia right now are feeling like they are trying to drink from a hose that has been turned on high due to the sheer bulk of reforms that are currently being developed and implemented. Changes have been made to standards, student and staff assessment and evaluation systems, teacher preparation programs, school and district accountability measures and a host of other instructional practices to keep pace with 21st century classrooms.\\\\nPrevious columns here addressed the first three. This column focuses on the final piece of the education puzzle \\\\u2013 the education leader. The one that makes sure the entire puzzle is put together.\\\\nAs these puzzle pieces are being implemented in the school systems, the question of leadership becomes paramount. Local district leaders, the local boards of education and superintendents, have enormous power to support principals and teachers in driving instructional improvement.\\\\nResearch has shown that when district leaders effectively address specific responsibilities, they can, and do, have a profound, positive impact on student achievement in their districts.\\\\nIn a successful school, students are learning the material. High-quality teachers are being trained and retained in the classrooms. School leaders are making sure all is functioning well and students and educators are supported through the longitudinal data system. Where can we see the results? The College and Career Ready Performance Index (CCRPI). The CCRPI is the state\\\\u2019s accountability measure that moves away from the old Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) single measure. Schools are now rated using an index score of 0-100 that is comprised of multiple measures including student achievement, and progress measures on student growth, achievement gap closures and efforts to prepare students for college and or a career. The CCRPI also measures the climate of a school and its financial effectiveness.\\\\nThe third consecutive year of results for the CCRPI was recently released and Georgia schools are experienced a slight decrease from 2013 to 2014. See table below.\\\\nIt is too early to tell if this trend signals an emerging downward trend in Georgia, or is simply schools adjusting to more rigorous standards and increased expectations. Either way, it is incumbent upon the school leader to understand the data in the CCPRI and be able to use the individual indicators to pinpoint where there are areas in need of improvement` and where the school excels, allowing for greater efficiency in resources and targeted interventions.\\\\nAs these reforms are being implemented, positive and competent leadership is needed to ensure teachers are being supported, evaluations are being implemented with fidelity, and data systems are being used to their fullest potential and more. And, of course, leaders must be able manage this process while dealing with tight budgetary constraints.\\\\nLocal community and business leaders have a role to play in supporting their local and district school leaders as they implement this puzzle. Many of the high school indicators that inform the CCRPI relate to career pathways and college readiness.\\\\nBusinesses can partner with local schools for internships, serving as mentors, and highlighting career options.\\\\nCommunity organizations can provide wrap around service for high need or struggling students. Partnering with local school system to inform and support their strategic plan for improving student outcomes is the best investment communities can make in their future.\\\\nThis is the fourth in a series of entries that detail the four defining edges of Georgia\\\\u2019s education reform puzzle. This issue, as well as other key education issues, is addressed in the Georgia Partnership for Excellence in Education\\\\u2019s Top Ten Issues to Watch in 2014 report.\"}\\n',\n",

Initially the task will not have a performer assigned, thus the assigned user will be labeled as Unassigned.\\\\nIn the next section of the article you can find information related to the assigned performer once someone opens the task or marks himself as assigned, that is, after taking ownership of the task.\\\\nAs previously mentioned, when the Everyone assignation method is selected for a task, all users will have the activity available on their inbox but no one will be actually assigned as responsible.

Notice that initially and by default the option is not ticked.\\\\nA person that has a task assigned, may not be able to perform it or for any other reason, might want someone else to be accountable for it. Thus, Bizagi provides the Release functionality.\\\\nWhen a person is already assigned to a task, when he/she enters to work on it, on the upper right corner of the activity a Release button will be available.\\\\nWhen such button is clicked, the task will go back to everyone\\'s Inbox, by running assignation rules again. This means that if the assignation method of the task is Everyone, it will be unassigned and available for all users that match its preconditions, including the user that just released the task.\\\\n\\\\u2022Read only mode is enabled at runtime for end users when the task has been allocated to more than one user, AND the Everyone allocation method is present in at least one of the preconditions to assign the task\\'s performers.\\\\n\\\\u2022When a case has not been assigned, namely no one has taken its ownership (or no one has opened the task if the read only view is disabled), reassigning the task will only add the selected user to the list of users who can take the task\\'s ownership, this action will not assign the task to the selected user.\\\\n\\\\u2022The Take ownership/Release capabilities are not available for delegated users.

If active co-operation is required on the customer\\\\u2019s part on another server, e.g. during the transfer of a web space package or other data stored on the provider\\\\u2019s servers, the customer shall provide such co-operation in accordance with the provider\\\\u2019s instructions and within the stipulated time.\\\\n(3) If no other agreement has been reached the provider shall be entitled to demand payment in advance for all services ordered by the customer for the respective period.\\\\nAll webhosting packages (\\\\u201cvirtual servers\\\\u201d) offered by the provider (Tomattos) assume a minimum service period of twelve months with an automatic extension of the agreement and the corresponding domains/servers for twelve months.\\\\nAll server packages (dedicated servers, colocated servers, VPS, game servers) offered by the provider (Tomattos) assume a minimum service period selected by the customer when placing the order with an automatic extension of the contract and the corresponding domains/servers for the minium service period chosen by the customer.\\\\n(4) Once the payment which had been made by the customer in advance for the agreed term has expired the contract is automatically terminated.\\\\nThe domains associated with the packages/servers however, are charged for the complete contract period (this is dependent upon the domain extension and can be seen here) and must be terminated at least 4 weeks before expiry of the contract period in order to prevent automatic extension of the agreement (an extension is equivalent to renewed registration in respect of the contract period). If the package/server is terminated before the end of the contract for the relevant domain(s) or if the contract has not yet ended or has not yet been renewed, you will be charged separately to cover the remaining months of the domain service. The amount charged depends on the extension of the domain (for a complete list, please click here).\\\\n(5) Given that the customer is placing the order as a private customer (as defined by \\\\u00a7 13 BGB), the following applies: The customer has to pay the provider an appropriate fee which equals the the ratio of the services already rendered in relation to the total services intially intended for the contract, up to the point when the customer informed the provider about the enactment of his right of revocation regarding the contract. This is true in particular for yearly costs of ordering Internet domains. The reason for this is that these Internet domains are ordered individually according to the customer\\\\u2019s wish from the responsible registry and such orders have to be paid by the provider for one year in advance. This is why advances rendered by the customer will be withheld, in general. Due to the installation and start of operation of the hosting services ordered by the customer (setup and configuration of the web space or server, the domain or the colocation space as well as the Internet uplink required, setup of upgrades, etc.), which the provider is contractually obligated to perform, the provider explicitly reserves the right to demand appropriate compensation for lost value if the costs for the services rendered by the provider in relation to the total services intended for the contract are not covered by advances made by the customer.\\\\n(6) Should the provider be commissioned by the customer to provide services that are over and above the duties and responsibilities detailed in these General Terms and Conditions and in the service description (e.g. software-configuration, correction of errors or problems etc., that were not caused by the provider) the provider shall be entitled to demand adequate remuneration. In this case, a standard payment of \\\\u20ac 25.00 per 15 minute unit of work shall be agreed. The provider may vary from this payment for the benefit of the customer as he sees fit.\\\\n(7) The responsibility for backups of his data lies with the customer, not the provider.\\\\n(8) The provider shall be entitled to to increase fees up to once per quarter. Such an increase requires the agreement of the customer. The agreement of the customer shall be given if he does not dissent within 4 weeks after receipt of the message informing him about the change. The provider is obliged to inform the customer about the repercussions of not dissenting within 4 weeks. As long as the main obligation, i.e. the obligation of payment of the basic usage-independent monthly remuneration, is not concerned, the provider determins the remuneration according to equitable discretion.\\\\n(9) In case the value-added tax is increased, the provider shall be entitled to adjust the remuneration for goods and services, which are adduced or delivered within a continuing obligation, accordingly, starting at the point of time the value-added tax-change comes into effect.\\\\n(10) It is agreed that payments made by the customer will not be refunded regardless of their original purpose \\\\u2013 except in the case of an effective revocation, but then by inclusion of \\\\u00a7 1(5). In case the customer made a payment higher than the amount of fees being required until the end of the contract and the fees for ordered services until then, it is agreed that the balance will not forfeit. Instead of a refund, the balance will be used for the provision of other / new services which the customer can order from the provider at any time.\\\\n(1) The customer expressly assures that the provision and publication of web page content created either by himself and/or web pages created for him by the provider based on information provided by the customer neither infringes Bangladeshi law nor any other law applicable in the customer\\\\u2019s country of residence, in particular copyright, data protection and competition law. The provider reserves the right to remove any pages from storage on his server that appear to be of dubious content. The provider shall immediately inform the supplier about any intended deletion of pages. The same shall apply if the provider is requested by third parties to change or delete contents of web pages because they allegedly violate third party rights.\\\\n(2) The provider shall be entitled to delete any such web pages from hard disk storage on his web server if such pages are likely to infringe third party rights. He shall also be entitled to prevent access by third parties by taking any appropriate action. The provider undertakes to notify the customer immediately about any such measure. Should the customer be able to provide proof that there are no concerns regarding infringement of third party rights the provider shall make the web pages concerned available again to third parties. The customer hereby agrees to hold the provider harmless from any claims by third parties resulting from the content of materials on the customer\\\\u2019s website(s).\\\\n(3) The clauses 1 and 2 are also applicable for all other products offered by the provider which are suitable for publishing data, such as VPS or colocated servers.\\\\n(1) Should domain registration or domain hosting form part of the services offered to the customer, the provider shall act only in the capacity of mediator between the customer, DENIC, InterNIC or other domain registration authority. Agreements with such organisations have the sole purpose of governing the customer\\\\u2019s rights and obligations.\\\\n(2) The provider has no influence on the delegation of domain names. He therefore cannot warrant that the registered domain names are not subject to claims by third parties or that they are unique or permanent. This also applies to sub-domains allocated within the provider\\\\u2019s domain.\\\\n(3) If the customer should be requested by a third party to surrender a domain because it may infringe third party rights, he shall inform the provider immediately. In such cases the provider shall be entitled to surrender the Internet domain on behalf of the customer. The customer hereby agrees to hold the provider harmless from any claims by third parties resulting from disputes regarding inadmissible use of domain names.\\\\n(4) The customer hereby warrants to the provider that the address information (consisting of at least his name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) provided during registration or setting up a new account is correct and complete. Should this information change then the provider must be notified immediately in writing (letter, e-mail, fax). This and under certain conditions further information, will also be used for domains ordered by the customer from the provider.\\\\n(1) If the provision of e-mail addresses or e-mail services forms part of the services offered by the provider, the limitations set out in \\\\u00a7 3 shall apply analogously to e-mail addresses provided for the customer. The provider reserves the right to delete the customers e-mail messages if they are not retrieved from the mail server within 4 weeks of receipt.\\\\n(2) If provision of access to public discussion forums (newsgroups) forms part of the services offered by the provider the time period over which public news is stored shall depend upon operational considerations of the provider.\\\\n(3) The provider shall not be responsible for the e-mail addresses he provides; their use and management is outside the control of the provider. In the case of misuse, the provider shall be entitled to suspend all or individual e-mail addresses. The customer shall be informed immediately about such measures.\\\\n(1) For webspace-packages, the following applies: The customer must ensure that his web site is designed such that the server is not excessively loaded, e.g. caused by CGI/PHP scripts requiring considerable computing power or above average memory usage. Excessive loading shall be defined as such usage of the aforementioned resources such that the operation of a Tomattos server is noticeably impaired or even crashes. Tomattos reserves the right to prohibit customers or third parties from accessing pages that do not comply with the aforementioned requirements.\\\\n(3) For game servers, the following applies: Clan Servers will be supplied by the provider solely with password protection, so that players can only connect to them and participate in ongoing games after typing in a password. This password set by the provider may never be removed by the customer. Moreover, the password may never be completely or in part nor in any other way which will make it guessable or restorable be published in the server name or elsewhere. The password is to be kept secret by the customer and may only be passed on within his clan or a comparable community \\\\u2013 to each player individually. The customer has to make sure that players who receive the password strictly adhere to this paragraph.\\\\n(4) For game servers, the following applies: If the customer has ordered the upgrade \\\\u201cTomattos branding\\\\u201d for his game server, the name of the server will be extended by an advertisement supplied by the provider (e.g. \\\\u2018by Tomattos.com\\\\u2019). This extension by the provider may never \\\\u2013 also not in part \\\\u2013 be removed by the customer.\\\\n(5) Should clause 1 to 4 be applicable, the provider reserves the right to immediately suspend the webspace package or server. This course of action will also be implemented should other sites stored on the server be affected by the customer\\\\u2019s site. The customer shall be informed about any such suspension.\\\\n(6) In case of such a suspension, solely the customer, not the provider shall be accountable for infringements of contracts. In any case the provider\\\\u2019s claim of payment of remuneration remains, for the entire contract period.\\\\n(1) The provider concedes complete and sole administration-rights on rented/colocated servers to the customer. Only the customer knows the individual administration-password of the server, not the provider. The provider is therefore unable to administrate the rented/colocated server. Hence the customer is solely and entirely responsible for administration and security of his servers, at his own expenses and risks. It is his duty to install necessary security-software and to inform himself constantly regarding security issues as well as to fix such by himself. Installation of maintenance software or other software does not absolve the customer from this duty.\\\\n(2) Should customers receive fixed IP-addresses, the provider reserves the right to change these when technical needs arise and to inform the customer about his new IP-address.\\\\n(3) If necessary and reasonable, the customer will assist at simple configuration changes, such as entering the login-data anew, or simple changes of his systems.\\\\n(4) It is the customer\\\\u2019s duty to configure his programs in such a way that they are restarted automatically when the hardware or the operating system is restarted.\\\\n(5) For game servers, the following applies: The provider concedes complete and sole administration-rights on the rented game server to the customer, within the limits of the functional range of the web interface supplied by the provider. The customer, however, does not receive complete root or SSH access for the used game host server. The startup parameters of the game server cannot be changed by the customer.\\\\n(1) The provider guarantees an annual mean 95%-availability of the physical connection of his webspace packages, dedicated, colocated, virtual servers and game servers. Exempted hereof are periods of time in which the servers are not reachable over the internet due to technical or other problems which do not lie within the provider\\\\u2019s sphere of influence (force majeure, faults of third parties or of the customer).\\\\n(2) The servers located in the datacenters of the provider are connected to the internet over a complex network infrastructure. Data traffic is routed over different active and passive network components (routers, switches, and other devices), which have a certain maximum data throughput. Therefore data throughput capacities can be limited for particular servers at particular points and not be equal to the maximum allowed data throughput of the respective switch-port. Unless otherwise agreed, the provider cannot give a guarantee for the amount of actually available bandwidth for individual servers, but makes available bandwidth depending on the technical capability of the datacenter, taking into account obligations towards other customers.\\\\n(3) Customers can use the servers of the provider or own colocated servers for an manageable amount of different applications and use various software programms to this purpose, at their own discretion. Because of this, millions of different configurations are possible. The sheer diversity of these option does not permit the provider to give guarantees for the utilizability and compatibility of servers for a certain purpose.\\\\nExcept for the specifications made in the description of the offer, the provider cannot give guarantees for the actual resources available for individual webspace packages, VPS and game servers. Rather, the provider makes available resouces depending on technical possibilities, taking into account obligations towards other customers.\\\\n(1) The customer agrees that his personal data (basic data) and other information concerning use of the service (e.g. time, number and duration of connections, access passwords, uploads and downloads) may be stored by the provider during the period of the agreement should this be necessary for fulfilling the purpose of the contract, particularly for invoicing. The customer agrees to the storage of data. The provider may also processes and utilise such personal data that has been collected for the purpose of advising his customers, for advertising and market research for his own purposes and for structuring his telecommunication services in accordance with requirements. The customer shall be entitled to object to such use of his personal data.\\\\n(2) Upon request by the customer the provider undertakes at any time and at no charge to provide full access to stored personal data pertaining to the customer. The provider shall not disclose this data or any of the customer\\\\u2019s personal messages to third parties unless he is legally required to do so, in particular to government bodies or should this be required by internationally recognised technical standards.\\\\n(3) The provider expressly points out that the protection of data privacy for data transmission across open networks such as the Internet cannot be fully guaranteed with current technology. The customer acknowledges and accepts that the provider is entitled at any time to view the websites stored on his server and, under certain conditions, any of the customer\\\\u2019s data stored there if technical requirements so dictate. Other unauthorised Internet users may also be technically able to interfere with network security and control the flow of messages.\\\\nThe customer warrants that all information he has given to Tomattos is correct and complete. Upon request the customer agrees to immediately inform Tomattos of any changes and to reconfirm that the data is currently correct within 7 days of receiving any such request.\\\\n\\\\u2013 and if the customer provides his own name server, the IP addresses of the primary and secondary name servers including the names of these servers.\\\\n(4) The clauses in \\\\u00a7 8 do not affect \\\\u00a7 16(4).\\\\nThe provider shall be liable for any damages caused by him or factors, servants and assignees through gross negligence or intent. In cases of violation of essential contractual obligations and slight negligence which lead to financial losses liability shall be limited to a liability insurance procured by the provider (with regard to the amount of liability) and to predictable, imminent losses (with regard to the type of liability).The limitations of liability stated above do not concern claims of the customer regarding product liability and especially do not apply for damage caused to the customer\\\\u2019s health (or loss of life) attributable to the provider. Otherwise, liability is excluded.\\\\nThe customer indemnifies the provider against all possible third party claims arising from any illegal action by the customer or from errors in the information provided by the latter. This applies in particular to copyright, data protection and competition law violations. Tomattos shall not be obliged to check the customer\\\\u2019s websites for possible legal violations.\\\\n(1) Applicable law is that of the The Peoples Republic of Bangladesh.\\\\n(2) Any dispute resulting from this agreement shall be referred solely to a court of competent jurisdiction at the place of business of the provider.\\\\n(2) In the case of incorrect direct debits/credit card debits (possibly caused by an overdrawn account, incorrect account data etc.) additional bank charges and increased administrative costs will arise for the provider. The provider will therefore charge a flat fee of \\\\u20ac 15.00 for an incorrect direct debit and a flat fee of \\\\u20ac 30.00 for an incorrect credit card debit.\\\\n(3) In the case of a failed debit collection, the provider may immediately claim default interest fixed by law. Additionally, the provider shall be entitled to discontinue the service contract until payment is made. The provider shall be entitled to suspend the contract and reallocate the rented capacities. Data loss cannot be ruled out in this case. A one-time-fee of \\\\u20ac 30.00 is computed by the provider when re-activating the service for the customer.\\\\nIn the case of a non-payment until the second date mentioned in the demand note an additional fee of \\\\u20ac 58.00 is computed for mandating a lawyer.\\\\n(4) The provisions set out in paragraph 3 shall also apply in the case of non-payment if the customer has selected the payment option \\\\u201cbank transfer\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cPayPal\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cSkrill\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cWestern Union\\\\u201d or a similar, comparable payment option. Delay of payment is the case when, at the first of a given month, the services of the provider have not been prepaid for the entire month.\\\\n(5) In case of NGO/NPO offers there is no refund or credit back. Any claim of such refubd or credit back will be not entertained. In additional lawyer charges may applicable in case of any legal procedure needed to perform.\\\\n(6) In case of custom quoted servers, the non-refund and no credit back will applicable too.\\\\n(7) Payment Policy Page terms will be also applicable except special cases.\\\\nThe customer thus agrees to comply with the corresponding provisions and is responsible for observing them correctly.\\\\nThese provisions may result in only having restricted or even not having the possibility to use otherwise purchased licenses of the customer with the servers of the provider. The provider will supply a license for all customer orders of Microsoft software products considering the Microsoft Service Provider License Agreement. This license allows the monthly use of the Microsoft software product on the server and limits its utilization permission with regard to some aspects. The customer particularly must not use Microsoft products which require additional or other licenses according to SPUR. The customer is obligated to comply with all these provisions on his own and is liable for violations against this usage policy to the provider and Microsoft.\\\\n(1) The provider is obliged to enable a connection to the internet and a storing position for the server according to the respective product description.\\\\n(2) The provider does not provide any guarantee for hardware damage which can result, for example, from transport to the datacenter, back to the customer or during going concern.\\\\n(3) The provider grants the customer access to his server-system during the office-times published on the homepage of the provider in order to allow the customer to work on the server-system. This requires, however, a written request which has to be addressed to the support-department of the provider, at least 48 hours in advance. To access the server-system, the ID Card of the customer or a statement of authority signed by the customer is necessary. During the customer\\\\u2019s presence in the datacenter, the provider has to fulfill various duties of supervision and control. Since this requires the attendance of the provider\\\\u2019s personnel, costs of \\\\u20ac 50.00 per started hour incur. With prior agreement, the provider can abstain from this at his sole discretion. If the appointment is not kept, the customer has to cancel it at least 2 hours in advance (if during office hours) or at least 12 hours in advance (if outside of office hours). If there is no cancellation within the stated time periods and the appointment is not kept, the customer will be billed for \\\\u20ac 30.00.\\\\n(4) Reboots are provided for free by the provider at the customer\\\\u2019s request unless stated otherwise in the product description and unless the amount of reboots per month does not create disproportional effort.\\\\n(5) Other technical support services are not included with the offer. If the help of a technician is required, costs of \\\\u20ac 25.00 per started 15 minutes incur.\\\\n\\\\u2013 In case of an outage / non-availability of electricity, UPS or air conditioning, the provider will immediately, at the latest during the next working day, undertake all measures necessary to restore going concern.\\\\n(7) Claims resulting from operational outage of peripherals (air conditioning, electricity) can only be asserted in case of violation of the guarantees mentioned in clause 6 up to the monthly amount for the colocated server and only if the outage has been lasting for over 72 hours (continuously, without breaks). If financial losses are claimed, these have to be substantiated and will be redeemed after verification up to an amout of \\\\u20ac 500.00.\\\\nIn case of an bandwidth-outage such claims are only valid if the guarantees regarding bandwidth made in \\\\u00a7 7 clause 1 are undercut.\\\\n(8) The provider does not assume liability for damage or loss of data.\\\\n(9) The customer is responsible that the colocated equipment is flawless so that no negative impact for other devices can emanate from it.\\\\n(10) The customer is liable for possible damages emanating from the server and is responsible for an adequate insurance.\\\\n(11) If the provider informs the customer immediately, at least one month in advance, that he has decided to move to a different location, each party has a special cancellation right and can cancel the performances specified in this contract that are provided in the location which will change using written form. The cancellation will come into effect on the day the location is about to change. Given that the provider has informed the customer accordingly and neither party has made use of their special cancellation right, the contract continues unchanged at the new location. This clause does not come into effect if the reason for the change of the location is an instant dismissal of the rental agreement between the provider and his lessor. In this case, only clause 12 applies.\\\\n(12) The customer is aware of the fact that the provider himself has to rent the datafloor. If this contract concerns the housing and bandwidth provided in the datacenter, the contract concerning this performance ends automatically at the point of time when the rental agreement between the provider and his lessor ends by means of an instant dismissal and the provider has been unable to find a suitable new location. The provider will inform the customer immediately. Other agreements remain untouched.\\\\n(13) If the server of the customer needs more electricity or space than specified in the rented offer, additional housing-modules need to be rented \\\\u2013 when only noticed later, this change will be retroactive. The number and price of the required additional modules is specified on the homepage of the provider.\\\\n\\\\u2013 The customer is informed immediately about such a change.\\\\n\\\\u2013 The customer has a special cancellation right for bandwidth and housing in the affected datacenter: He can cancel affected subscriptions within three months upon receipt of the message informing him about the change. This special cancellation right is valid during the mentioned three months-period. If it is not used, the contract continues under the adjusted conditions.\\\\n(15) The customer agrees to the fact that the provider opens the case of the colocated server and adds a \\\\u2018Web Resetter\\\\u2019 to the reset-pin of the mainboard. Using this device, the provider is able to restart the server of the customer at any time if the customer requests it. Furthermore, the customer is able to reboot the server himself using the aforementioned device if he orders the necessary upgrade. In case the server is returned to the customer, the provider will remove the \\\\u2018Web Resetter\\\\u2019 again.\\\\n(16) The customer is aware of and agrees to the fact that the provider publishes (Live-)video material and static pictures of his datacenter and that these videos/images might picture equipment or servers of the customer.\\\\n(17) If the customer is in delay of payment for any performance between him and the provider, the provider has the right to keep the server and/or equipment of the customer in his posession until payment is made in full.\\\\n(18) The customer grants the provider a lien on colocated servers and other equipment to back claims resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer. The lien only expires once all debt resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer has been paid and the contract has ended. Starting with the inception of treaty, the customer has to inform the provider immediately should the server not be or cease to be his property, be pledged or assigned. If the customer is entitled to other rights to the colocated server, especially expectant right, he assigns these to the provider in order to back debts resulting from the contract between the provider and the customer.\\\\n(19) The lien and the contractual lien can also be asserted for claims resulting from former services or other claims.\\\\n(20) If the provider excercises his lien, it shall suffice to send a written notice to the last known address of the customer. No further notice is required.\\\\n(21) Legal liens are unaffected by these terms.\\\\n(22) If the customer does not retrieve his server / other equipment within four weeks after the contract has ended, the provider will stock the items for a fee of \\\\u20ac 10 per item and per month.\\\\nThe provider has the right to change the subject terms of this contract as long as the changes are reasonable, taking into account the interests of the provider. The agreement of the customer shall be given if he does not dissent within 4 weeks after receipt of the message informing him about the change. The provider is obliged to inform the customer about the repercussions of not dissenting within 4 weeks.n.\\\\n(1) Amendments or additions to this contract are only valid if they have been agreed to in writing. This also applies to any amendment of this clause relating to written notification.\\\\n(2) All communications by the provider may be sent to the customer by electronic means. This also applies to invoices sent for services provided under the agreement.\\\\n(3) The customer may only set off claims against the provider if such claims are established as undisputed or legally binding.\\\\n(4) The provider is authorised to list the customer as a reference-customer without being obliged to pay a refund.\\\\n(5) All prices quoted are not binding unless they are confirmed contractually. Errors and omissions in our prices excepted.\\\\n(6) If any provision of this agreement is held to be invalid or becomes invalid or if there are omissions in the agreement that require rectification, the remaining provisions of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision or omission shall be replaced by a provision which comes closest to the intention of both parties as would have been agreed by the parties had they knowledge of such issues in advance.\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"A charge card is a card that provides a direct debit payment method enabling the cardholder to make purchases which are paid for by the card issuer, to whom the cardholder becomes indebted. The cardholder is obligated to repay the debt to the card issuer in full by the due date, usually on a monthly basis, or be subject to late fees and restrictions on further card use. Charge cards are distinct from credit cards in that credit cards are revolving credit instruments that do not need to be paid in full every month and a balance may be carried over, on which an interest is paid. Charge cards are typically issued without spending limits, but credit cards usually have a specified credit limit that the cardholder may not exceed.\\\\nIn 1914, Western Union opened the first charge account for its customers and provided them with a paper identification. There were many larger department stores which opened store charge accounts for their customers with paper identification, enabling the customer to make purchases on credit provided by the store. However, these accounts could be used only within the store which issued them. In 1950, Diners Club began opening charge accounts with paper identification cards, directed at the travel and entertainment markets. The novel feature of these cards was that the charge card could be used in a large number of stores. These stores had to enter an agreement with Diners Club, and pay a fee to the company. For the fee, Diners Club carried the cost of setting up accounts, authorizing each transaction, processing transactions and collections, bore the financing costs and assumed the risk of cardholders defaulting. The new system was especially appealing to smaller stores in competition with the larger stores but who could not justify setting up their own charge account facilities. Eventually the larger stores began accepting these cards, testifying that the fees charged by the card operator were lower than the store\\'s cost in running their own store accounts. In 1957, American Express also entered the field, and in 1959 was the first company to issue embossed plastic charge cards to ISO/IEC 7810 standards.\\\\nIn Europe, the MasterCard-affiliated Maestro brand (which is a debit card rather than a charge card) replaced the European Eurocheque brand for payment cards in 2002. Many Eurocheque cards, particularly in such countries as Austria and Germany, were charge cards branded with the Eurocheque logo. In addition, the European Eurocard, issued as the competitor for American Express was, and in some countries (such as the Nordic countries) still is, a charge card. Therefore, the majority of MasterCards in these countries still are charge cards. Visa charge cards are also available in Europe.\\\\nThe user of the charge card has to pay the balance of their account at the end of each month and the charge card company, unlike a credit card, does not charge interest. A charge card company\\'s main source of revenue is the merchant fee, which is a percentage of the transaction value which typically ranges between 1 and 4%, plus an interchange or minimum fee.\\\\nMany charge cards have the option for users to pay for some purchases over time. American Express charge card customers, for instance, can enroll in the Extended Payment Option (internally referred to as ExPO) to be able to pay for purchases over $200 over time, or in Sign & Travel to be able to pay for eligible travel-related expenses over time.\\\\nMost charge cards also have a feature called No Preset Spending Limit (NPSL). While consumers often take NPSL to mean that their cards are without limits, NPSL really means that a card\\'s limit changes, often from month-to-month, based on factors such as consumer charging and payment history as well overall economic trends. According to a CardHub.com NPSL study, the way NPSL charge cards are reported to the major credit bureaus varies by issuer and can lead to artificial increases in credit utilization, thereby lowering one\\'s FICO Score.\\\\nGovernments and large businesses often use charge cards to pay for and keep track of expenses related to official business; these are often referred to as purchasing cards. Some retailers and banks issue charge cards to customers (ex. British Petroleum, Speedway, Shell Oil Company, ExxonMobil, ARCO, Sinclair Oil Corporation, Kwik Fill, Kwik Trip, Silicon Valley Bank, Sunoco, FleetCor Technologies, Inc., U.S. Bank, Lloyds Bank, World Fuel Services, Casey\\'s General Stores, Edenred, 7-Eleven, Chevron Corporation, Valero Energy, MAPCO Express, Inc., Citgo, Lukoil, Phillips 66, Alon USA, Holiday Stationstores, PNC Financial Services, Citibank, Gulf Oil LP, Murphy USA, GetGo, Kum & Go, Meijer, QuikTrip, Sheetz, Wawa, Inc., Marathon Petroleum, Circle K, CEFCO, EZ GO Stores, Petrol Plus Region, Mansfield Energy Corp., Simonson Station Stores, ASAP Energy Inc., Daigle Oil Company, Riggins Inc., P-Fleet Inc.). Some American Express and Diners Club cards are charge cards, rather than credit or debit cards such as VISA and MasterCard. WEX Inc. issues 13 charge cards (all fuel cards). The SELECT Black Card is a charge card.\\\\n^ \\\\\"No Pre-Set Spending Limit Credit Card Study \\\\u2013 2010\\\\\". CardHub.com. Retrieved 2011-06-23.\"}\\n',\n",

The video highlights the basic principles at work in geothermal energy production, and illustrates three different ways the Earth\\'s heat can be converted into electricity.\\\\nBelow is the text version for the Energy 101: Geothermal Energy video.\\\\nThe words \\\\\"Energy 101: Geothermal Energy\\\\\" appear onscreen, followed by footage of a natural hot springs swimming pool.\\\\nYou may have relaxed in a natural hot springs pool.\\\\nFootage of a hot water geyser.\\\\nOr seen the Old Faithful geyser blasting hot water into the air in Yellowstone National Park. But have you ever thought of where all that heat comes from?\\\\nFootage of natural geothermal features.\\\\nWell, it comes from deep beneath the surface of the earth\\\\u2014and it\\'s called geothermal energy.\\\\nFootage of various geothermal energy facilities.\\\\nAnd we can use it to generate clean renewable electricity.\\\\nOK, here\\'s how geothermal works.\\\\nAnimation of how geothermal energy is generated underground.\\\\nHeat from the earth\\'s crust warms water that has seeped into underground reservoirs.\\\\nWhen water becomes hot enough it can break through the earth\\'s surface as steam or hot water. This usually happens where the earth\\'s crust or \\\\\"plates\\\\\" meet and shift.\\\\nIn the past, taking advantage of geothermal energy was limited to areas where hot water flowed near the surface. But as geothermal technologies advance, we can leverage even more of these natural renewable energy sources.\\\\nEngineers have developed a few different ways to produce power from geothermal wells drilled into the ground.\\\\nFootage of a dry steam geothermal energy facility.\\\\nHave a look at this. It\\'s a dry steam geothermal power plant, and it\\'s the most common type of geothermal technology used today. Underground steam flows directly to a turbine to drive a generator that produces electricity. Pretty straightforward.\\\\nAnimation of how geothermal energy is generated through a flash steam power plant.\\\\nAnother geothermal technology is called a flash steam power plant. A pump pushes hot fluid into a tank at the surface, where it cools. As it cools, the fluid quickly turns into vapor\\\\u2014or \\\\\"flash\\\\\" vaporizes. The vapor then drives a turbine and powers a generator.\\\\nFootage of a binary cycle geothermal energy facility.\\\\nA binary cycle plant works differently.\\\\nAnimation of how geothermal energy is generated through a binary cycle power plant.\\\\nIt uses two types of fluid. Hot fluid from underground heats a second fluid, called a heat transfer fluid, in a giant heat exchanger. The second fluid has a much lower boiling point than the first fluid, and so it \\\\\"flashes\\\\\" into vapor at a lower temperature. When the second fluid flashes, it spins a turbine that drives a generator.\\\\nThe environmental benefits of this clean, round-the-clock renewable energy source are substantial: low emissions, small physical footprint, and minimal environmental impact. The few byproducts that can come up are often re-injected underground.\\\\nFootage of a geothermal facility that recycles its wastewater.\\\\nGeothermal energy can also help recycle wastewater. In California, wastewater from the city of Santa Rosa is injected into the ground to generate more geothermal energy.\\\\nFootage of a geothermal facility that recovers and recycles its sulphur byproduct.\\\\nSome plants do produce solid waste, but that solid waste may contain minerals that we can remove and sell, which lowers the cost of this energy source.\\\\nThe U.S. Geological Survey estimates that untapped geothermal resources in the United States, if developed, could supply the equivalent of 10% of today\\'s energy needs.\\\\nIn fact, electricity generated by geothermal energy already provides about 60% of the power along the northern California coast.\\\\nFootage of the Golden Gate Bridge and a coastline.\\\\nFrom the Golden Gate Bridge to the Oregon state line.\\\\nGeothermal energy\\\\u2026helping to push America toward energy independence, and a clean, renewable way to meet our growing energy demands.\\\\nCaption: Energy 101: Geothermal Energy.

At the same time, a new displacement-sensing mechanism, demonstrating excellent integration capability and easy operation, is also proposed, exploiting the high sensitivity of the coupling of light between waveguides on their alignment. With this device, the kinetic coefficient of friction and the adhesion force appearing on the sidewall are experimentally measured to be 0.208 0.005 and 25.3 1.2 nN, respectively.

With one climb to go Scott made his move and managed some how to hold off a bunch of 10 riders as they raced 1.5kms of open gravel road. Scott has always been a bold rider and started this stage on the attack but was bought back by the bunch at the 6km mark. One of the talking points of this fast 40min stage was Adrian Jackson who mid pack had his front wheel cleaned up by a local black wallabie who had decided it was time to cross the road. As soon as the riders had seen the wallabie come from the side Adrian was surfing the road on his chest with bike nowhere to be seen. It was a gallant effort by Adrian to get back into the bunch and then win the sprint for a 2nd place.\\\\nThe race has been defined by Jack Haig! In the 4th stage over 60kms in length and including some tough climbing Jack has blown the field apart and gained near 6min time gap over Adrian Jackson with Peter Kutchera a further 4 mins back. Jack tested the boys on the road climb up the Great Ocean Road from Gellibrand river just 17kms in. In his post race interview he said he felt there that he was feeling better so with 25kms to go when they hit another climb he pushed harder again and got the break. It was an impressive ride by Jack and now leaves Adrian and Peter with alot of work to do if they are going to have any chance of victory in the event.\\\\nIts all Jack Haig and Peta Mullens at the 12 Apostles MTB classic as the events final stage is won in style!\\\\nJack once again was too strong for his competition breaking away on the undulating course with 15kms to go. Neither Adrian or Peter at anything in the tank to go with him and rode to defend their 2nd and 3rd overall placing. An admirable mention must go to Mark Fenner who was on the attack early and held on to finish 4th in a sprint finish.\\\\nPeta Mullens had a great ride finishing just outside the top 20 overall. Behind her though an early crash saw Bec Henderson retire from the race which then opened up the battle for 2nd place overall between Katherine O\\'Shea and Melissa Anset. The in form Melissa used the hills to hear advantage and got away to a lean which she worked hard to hold all day as Katherine pushed to keep her in site.

              " '{\"text\": \"For a long time in the anime, Ash had a Greninja that was a fan-favorite. So when I came across a deck featuring Greninja-GX FLI 24, I knew I had to take a look at it. I found it posted on the PokeBeach Forums by a user named MegaAbsol10. It was played by Alexandre Sole to a Top 8 finish at SPE Bolzano (seniors). Let\\'s take a look at the deck.\\\\nWith Greninja-GX FLI 24, you\\'re able to put three damage counters on any of your opponent\\'s Pokemon thanks to its Shuriken Flurry Ability. This can be especially useful after your opponent has retreated a damaged Pokemon that\\'s on its last legs. You can use this ability repeatedly by attacking with Haze Slash, which also happens to deal 110 damage in addition to shuffling Greninja-GX FLI 24 and all attached cards into your deck. Frogadier FLI 23\\'s Gale Shuriken Ability is similar to Shuriken Flurry, but deals one less damage. While these abilities may be a little slow, it\\'s important to evolve so that you get this extra damage and make it easier to knock out your opponent\\'s Pokemon quickly.\\\\nThe Freezing Gaze Ability of Glaceon-GX UPR 39 makes it so that your opponent\\'s Pokemon have no effect. This is especially great when facing Lycanroc-GX GRI 74 as you don\\'t have to worry as much about having your Active Pokemon switched with a Pokemon from your bench that might not be as powered up. But Lycanroc-GX GRI 74 isn\\'t the only Pokemon this affects. Tapu Lele-GX GRI 60, Zeraora-GX LOT 86, and Zoroark-GX SLG 53 all have great abilities that are nullified by Freezing Gaze. Glaceon-GX UPR 39 also has the Frost Bullet attack that deals 30 damage directly to an opponent\\'s Benched Pokemon while also dealing 90 damage to their Active Pokemon. KO\\'ing two Pokemon with one attack is quite possible with Frost Bullet.\\\\nWith Marshadow SLG 45\\'s Let Loose Ability, you\\'re able to disrupt your opponent\\'s plan after they\\'ve begun to sculpt their hand. It can also help you as a way to draw cards when you\\'ve played your hand out and have less than four cards in hand. You\\'ll never be able to attack with Marshadow SLG 45 though, as it\\'s Shadow Punch attack requires Psychic Energy, which you don\\'t have access to in this deck.\\\\nWhile you only have a single copy of Tapu Lele-GX GRI 60, playing it allows you to search your deck for any Supporter there. As you\\'ll see, the Supporters in this deck all help you draw additional cards or help set up favorable attacks. All are powerful effects, and having a copy of Tapu Lele-GX GRI 60 can help you find what you need quicker. In a pinch, you can also use Energy Drive as an attack thanks to it only requiring colorless Energy.\\\\nLillie UPR 125, Cynthia UPR 119, and Guzma BUS 115 are all of the Supporters in this deck. Lillie UPR 125 is best when played on your first turn, but she\\'s still good even later in the game. Cynthia UPR 119 is a great way to draw a new hand of cards when you have things that are not as useful in your hand or when you have only a couple of cards left. With Guzma BUS 115, you have a great way to set up an attack that allows you to knock out two of your opponent\\'s Pokemon with one Frost Bullet attack.\\\\nHere\\'s a group of cards that allow you either to search for specific cards you need, or to discard specific cards to your discard pile. Nest Ball SUM 123 can only find a Basic Pokemon, so it\\'s very limited. On the other hand, Ultra Ball SUM 135 can find any Pokemon you need. Both Ultra Ball SUM 135 and Acro Bike CES 123 will put cards into your discard pile, and you might want to consider putting a Water Energy 3 or two there for use later.\\\\nAqua Patch GRI 119 is the reason you might want a couple of Water Energy 3s in your discard pile. It allows you to power up a Benched Water Type Pokemon very quickly.\\\\nSwitch SUM 132 helps you move up a Pokemon that you\\'ve powered up with Aqua Patch GRI 119 and allows you to retreat a wounded Pokemon without paying the retreat cost.\\\\nEven though you might have shut off their Abilities with Glaceon-GX UPR 39\\'s Freezing Gaze Ability, many Pokemon-GX still have powerful attacks. One of the best way to deal with a Pokemon that has an attack you\\'d rather not have them using against you is to knock them out before they can use it. Choice Band GRI 121 helps you do that by dealing out a little bit of additional damage, which could be the difference between knocking the Pokemon-GX out or allowing it to get one last attack.\\\\nSuper Scoop Up BUS 124 offers you a way to return a Pokemon you have in play and all cards attached to it into your hand so that you can play it again. It\\'s a great way to utilize Greninja-GX FLI 24\\'s Shuriken Flurry Ability multiple times. It can also help you deny your opponent the chance to draw one (or more) of their Prize cards. Rescue Stretcher GRI 130 allows you a way to get Greninja-GX FLI 24 back if it happens to get knocked out.\\\\nIf you\\'re looking for a deck that has the ability to knock out multiple Pokemon with a single attack, you should give this deck a try. It\\'s a proven deck that looks like a lot of fun to play.\\\\nThank you to PokeBeach.com Forum user MegaAbsol10 for posting this decklist, and congratulations to Alexandre Sole on the Top 8 finish.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"The newly emerging \\\\u201cDigital Mobility\\\\u201d trend offers a less-hassled lifestyle, because smartphone users can now manage a variety of matters via their phones with greater ease and convenience.\\\\nOne of the major drivers of this lifestyle trend in Thailand is a government policy to promote e-payment services that cut cash management costs. That initiative has led to progress among many services. Examples include expanded use of chip-embedded debit cards (EDCs) and more EDC installations at card-accepting merchants, plus the introduction of the PromptPay service and QR code payments, which will surely change customer behaviour. Concurrently, more online services have been devised that allow users to make financial transactions via online platforms.\\\\nAccording to the Bank of Thailand, the number of mobile banking accounts had reached 26.3 million by the second-quarter of 2017, or 52.8 per cent year on year growth. As well, monetary transfers and payment transactions via mobile banking services had surged 99 per cent year on year.\\\\nNotably, inter-bank transfer transactions had increased nearly 131 per cent, due in large part to the launch of PromptPay service early in 2017, wherein over 90 per cent of PromptPay transfers were conducted on smartphones. Same bank transfers and payments via mobile banking services had risen 95 per cent and 87 per cent, respectively.\\\\nThe volume of mobile banking transactions accounts for 61 per cent of all banking transactions, becoming larger than the combined volume of transactions via Internet banking and ATMs.\\\\nAmid leapfrogging growth in mobile banking services, Kasikornbank has embarked upon strategies to meet this challenge. Being the No 1 Thai digital banking provider, KBank has enhanced their mobile banking capacity for broader service coverage to serve retail and SME customers, as well as e-commerce merchants, seeking fast and convenient trade transactions via three KBank applications.\\\\nThey include K Plus, which is now Thailand\\\\u2019s single most popular mobile banking application. The number of K Plus users is expected to reach 8 million by the end of this year and 10.8 million in 2018. Most recently, KBank has been promoting QR code payments \\\\u2013 an integral K Plus feature \\\\u2013 across the country by making it easier for merchants to agree to QR code payment acceptance. Marketing campaigns have encouraged customers to use the QR code payment system. This is another real challenge of leveraging technology to drive change in consumer behaviour.\\\\nThe goal of K Plus is to transform mobile banking into a lifestyle platform that could better meet all customer needs. In so doing, the lifestyle banking platform employs machine learning technology to analyse and develop guidelines in offering new services in line with customer behaviour. Among these services is marketing data targeting specific customers via the Mobile Life Plus menu on K Plus. In 2018, a cross-border money transfer menu will be added to K Plus \\\\u2013 \\\\u201clow-value remittance\\\\u201d will be a new dimension in cross-border money transfer services for retail customers. With this service, customers in Thailand would for the first time be able to transfer money via K Pus to recipients in over 40 countries worldwide, including China, the US, Britain, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and the European Union.\\\\nK Plus Shop is the only application from any Thai bank designed for merchants to receive payments via QR code. To facilitate over 9 million Chinese tourists visiting Thailand each year, K Plus Shop also allows merchants to receive payments from Alipay and WeChatPay. KBank targets around 2.5 million transactions by Chinese tourists per year. Currently, over 450,000 merchants have downloaded the K Plus Shop application, and it is expected that one million merchants will use it in 2018.\\\\nK Plus SME, a mobile banking application for SMEs, gives customers access to information and helps them to conveniently and quickly manage their own business and finances. Entrepreneurs can easily check their account balances, regardless of whether the money comes from an electronic transfer or a cheque, and the app even shows their own returned cheques. The total number of K Plus SME users should reach 420,000 by the end of this year and 500,000 in 2018.\\\\nCommercial banks are facing increasing competition from business rivals. Financial institutions, fintech start-ups and other businesses are eyeing to expand into financial services. Banks have to elevate their service capabilities to meet that challenge and facilitate changing customer behaviour. K Bank believes the transformation of mobile banking into a lifestyle platform will be the key answer, responding to the digital mobility trend and new lifestyles around the world today and in the future.\\\\nPatchara Samalapa is senior executive vice |president, Kasikornbank.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Celiac disease is a serious genetic autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Therefore, people with celiac disease must eat a gluten-free diet. The disease affects 1 in 100 people worldwide, and one in 133 people in the United States. Two and one-half million Americans are undiagnosed and are at risk for long-term health complications.\\\\nGluten, the culprit, is a family of dietary proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, oat, and other grains. It is the protein that makes dough elastic and gives bread its chewy texture. It is naturally poorly digested, and therefore more likely to engage the immune system than other proteins, even in people without celiac disease.\\\\nIn people with celiac disease, it damages the intestinal villi, which are very small finger-like projections found along the wall of the small intestine. When the villi are injured, the small intestine can\\\\u2019t properly absorb nutrients from food. So, again, people with celiac disease must avoid foods that contain gluten. Sometimes, they may feel isolated, as they must eat differently than others.\\\\nAnd\\\\u2026. we have not only a new trend in college dining halls, but also new insight in what actually causes celiac disease. A new study (Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease), published last week (April 7, 2017) in the journal Science, shows that Infection with reovirus, a common but otherwise harmless virus, can trigger the immune system to react to gluten, leading to the development of celiac disease. How? Usually, a regulatory immune response blocks inflammation to dietary antigens. However, a reovirus infection at sites where dietary gluten is present results in the induction of danger signals that confuse the immune system and lead it to develop an aggressive inflammatory immune response against gluten\\\\u2014it is this aggressive inflammatory response that may induce celiac disease.\\\\nFor the study, which was carried out in a mouse model, researchers used two different closely related but genetically different reovirus strains. They showed that genetic differences between viruses can change how they interact with the immune system. Both reovirus strains induced protective immunity and did not cause overt disease. However, one of the reovirus strains triggered an inflammatory immune response and the loss of oral tolerance to gluten, whereas the other strain did not.\\\\nThe study also found that celiac disease patients produces much higher levels of antibodies against reoviruses than those without the disease. The celiac patients who had high levels of reovirus antibodies also had much higher levels of IRF1 gene expression, a transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in the loss of oral tolerance to gluten. This suggests that infection with a reovirus can leave a permanent mark on the immune system, a mark that sets the stage for a later autoimmune response to gluten.\\\\nin the United States, babies are usually weaned from breastfeeding and given their first solid foods\\\\u2014often containing gluten\\\\u2014around six months of age. Children with immature immune systems are more susceptible to viral infections at this stage, and for those genetically predisposed, the combination of an intestinal reovirus infection with the first exposure to gluten could create the right conditions for developing celiac disease.\\\\nI think this is a groundbreaking discovery as so many people are affected by celiac disease. Hopefully, this will help foster further research not only to prevent celiac disease but also to possibly cure those who already have it. After doing some research, I found that reoviruses are oncolytic and are being looked at as potential treatments for cancer. In a study done by Kim et al., it was found that an attenuated reovirus targeted cancer cells in severely immunodeficient mice without killing healthy stem cells. The attenuated reovirus also exhibited reduced toxicity compared to a wild-type reovirus . The study also implies that attenuated reoviruses could be used to treat cancer in pregnant women (1). With the recent connection of reoviruses to celiac disease, I cannot help but wonder whether this will influence their potential use for treating cancer. Could reovirus cancer treatments cause an individual to develop celiac disease? If children infected with reovirus are at a higher risk of celiac disease, are reoviruses really safe to use for cancer treatment in pregnant women?\\\\nI find all the points you discuss fascinating \\\\u2013 thanks for sharing. I didn\\\\u2019t know that reovirus was being used as a treatment for cancer. Going off on your comment, I decided to investigate the specific cancers that use reovirus-based therapy. I found out that reovirus can be employed for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, and is more effective if used in combination with other drugs. (1) Reolysin (the drug name that uses reovirus) works by inducing stress in the endoplasmic reticulum, which eventually leads to apoptosis. Amazingly, Reolysin can selectively attack the cancerous cells due to reovirus\\\\u2019 ability to differentiate cells that express mutations in activated Ras signaling, specifically KRas. These mutations help facilitate viral uncoating and production of viral progeny in the cell. (2) I do share your concerns though about the potential side effects of using reovirus as a treatment \\\\u2013 this should be thoroughly studied as the treatment looks quite promising.\\\\nOver the past couple of years, scientists are starting the discover the importance of gut microbial and its effects on food digestion and the immune system. In the case of Celiac Disease, a virus or maybe a bacterial infection can affect the intestinal tract leading to developing celiac disease. But what about other autoimmune diseases that deal with food absorption? According to a new study (1) gut, microbial metabolites protect against type 1 diabetes. In this study, they took mice that had type 1 diabetes and fed them a diet that would increase the amounts of acetate and butyrate released by gut microbial. It turns out that if your gut microbial produce increase levels of acetate it decreases the frequency of autoreactive T cells in lymphoid tissues. Acetate effects the B cell preventing them from activating more autoreactive T cells. Increased levels of butyrate increased the number and function of regulatory T cells. It appears that dietary changes for people with T cell-dependent autoimmune diseases may be an effective natural way of treatment. Another study (2) suggested that there might be a connection between an accumulation of autoreactive T cells in the gut-associated lymphatic tissue and other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. I think we often overlook our diet and how it affects our overall health and not just our waistline. These emerging studies could also lead to new noninvasive ways of treatment.\\\\nShannon, it is so interesting that autoreactive T cells could do so much damage and contribute do a disease that is widely accepted as a genetic disorder. This post made me want to look up what else autoreactive T cells could do in the human body and I found that they are also a large part of development of Rheumatoid Arthritis (1). The autoreactive T cells actually reduce glycolysis and cause the CD4+T cells to hyperproliferate and attain the inflammatory symptoms we see as symptoms in Rheumatoid Arthritis. This made me wonder what dietary changes could these patients make to reduce their levels of autoreactive T cells? According to a new study (2), by taking a fish oil supplement can reduce the number of autoreactive T cells all together. They also showed in this study that the fish oil also promoted an increase in CD8+ T cells in mice. More supporting evidence was found in another study (3) that showed that fasting in regular intervals also decreases autoreactive T cells that contribute to multiple sclerosis symptoms. Seeing how diet can influence all of these major diseases is eye opening and definitely needs to be explored as alternative or combination treatments for patients.\\\\nResearchers are connecting the dots more and more everyday between autoimmune diseases and bacterial infections causing them. In a recent study, a connection was made between gut mycobacteria imbalance and the development of Chron\\\\u2019s disease as well as ulcerative colitis (1). There is a very particular balance of bacteria that are good for us and help digest our foods for us throughout our digestive tract, but when this balance is lost, some of the bacteria can grow exponentially, causing havoc in the gastrointestinal system. The bacteria is kept in check by our bodies by controlling the pH and temperature along the GI tube, when these checks are overridden the bacteria are allowed to have a field day and grow without being controlled by the host body. One study that was found recently, focuses on what happens to your gut microbiome when you starve the body of carbohydrates as in a ketogenic diet (2). As you starve your body from carbohydrates to try and lose weight the Bacteriodes that call your gut home and whose sole purpose is to digest carbs begin to die off. This pruning of the gut microbiota allows for more invasive species to overgrow and populate areas of the GI tract that they usually are not found in. This also promotes the growth of very harmful strains of bacteria to grow that are usually kept in check by the growth of the Bacteriodes, such as Clostridium difficule (2). The research on this topic is now pointing toward the overgrowth of some bacteria getting through the gut walls and into the abdominal cavity to elicit an immune response. After a prolonged period of bacteria entering the gut, the body starts to see the intestines as foreign cells, and it immune system shifts its focus to fighting off the \\\\u2018invader,\\\\u2019 that is actually the body\\\\u2019s own cells. This is what is supposedly causing the autoimmune diseases such as Chron\\\\u2019s.\\\\nWith research coming out on how viruses and bacteria can cause autoimmune diseases it makes you wonder how strong a role genetics play. It seems like gut flora is the missing link for a lot of diseases. In \\\\u201cDoes the Gut Microbiota Influence Immunity and Inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis Pathophysiology?\\\\u201d their aim was to determine if gut microflora plays a role in developing MS (1). While it is unclear how exactly gut microflora contributes to the development of MS, there is a relationship. As you mentioned earlier a stable gut flora protects against inflammation. In another study, it was noted how there are gut microbiota-host interactions that play a role in the development of cardiovascular diseases (2). Again, the pathophysiology is unclear but with immerging studies I imagine the relationship will soon be discovered. I think more research so go into the gut-immunity-brain axis.\\\\nThis article was very interesting to me as it pertains to gluten and how reovirus plays a part in celiac disease. Many people suffer with gluten and have to take great measures to get by day by day. One thing I found interesting was the idea how reovirus, usually considered an inoffensive virus, can \\\\u201ctrick\\\\u201d the immune system to believe that gluten is harmful and causes the immune system to have a belligerent response to gluten. This is dangerous not only to adults but the article also pointed out that it can be critical to children and infants. Studies have been done to test rotavirus vaccinations in children with celiac disease as well as type 1 diabetes (1). According to Outi, their studies suggest that this vaccination can be beneficial for children who have a high chance of contracting celiac disease or type 1 diabetes. This research is just the tip of the iceberg in learning more on the relationship of rotavirus and celiac disease.\\\\nOffering tastier gluten free foods should be a major matter in the upcoming years. Not only gluten free diet reduces the tragedy of celiac disease; but it also minimizes the symptoms associated with schizophrenia. A study that was published in April 2017 showed that schizophrenic patients who follow a gluten free diet suffer way less than those who have gluten included in their diet (1). Gluten could be associated with more diseases and some more studies on gluten effects on the human body should be done. Therefore, having tastier gluten free foods available in schools, hotels, hospitals, restaurants, ..etc. should be a major concern within the next years.\\\\nYour comment on how gluten-free options can reduce symptoms of schizophrenia is interesting. I do not know much about schizophrenia but I know people with this disorder suffer with the symptoms associated as well as the community surrounding them. I believe having a gluten-free diet benefits these individuals in more ways than one. I found an article stating how athletes who adhere to a gluten-free diet had better success in their goals as well as their body systems (1). Little is known on this study but it\\\\u2019s interesting how gluten-free diets can be beneficial for anyone.\\\\nCoeliac disease is a serious ailment affecting more and more children every year. Because of the rapid increase in coeliac disease diagnosis, it is important to diagnose exactly what type of gluten-related disease a person has. Depending on the severity of the coeliac disease, doctors can determine a patient\\\\u2019s ideal diet to decrease the negative effects of the disease and better the overall lifestyle of the patient. In a study done recently, it was reported that anti-glutaminase antibodies are specific for the diagnosis of coeliac disease and in determining specific symptoms . There are three specific gluten-related disorders: coeliac disease, wheat allergy, and noncoeliac gluten sensitivity. However, further research must be conducted to better understand noncoeliac gluten sensitivity as not much is known about this disease. It is important to conduct research on, not only coeliac disease but also, the other kinds of gluten-related ailments. These are important especially in relation to the health of young children. It is detrimental to the already fragile immune system of a child to develop coeliac disease. Like this blog post mentioned, this disease can affect all aspects of someone\\\\u2019s life and, as an aspiring pediatrician, I would like to see more emphasis on discovering how to aid children in preventing coeliac disease.\\\\nI had heard of celiac disease before but I was unaware that there were other gluten related disorders. After reading your post, I agree that there needs to be more research into these disorders as well. In a study by Unde et al., they attempted to identify markers for systemic immune activation in wheat sensitive individuals who did not have celiac disease. They determined that these individuals had higher levels of CD14 and LPS-binding protein in their serum. They noted that there was systemic immune activation because of antibody reactivity to bacterial LPS and flagellin. They also found levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 which indicated damage to the intestinal epithelium (1). I think more research like this will bring other gluten sensitive disorders to light. It may also help us determine more distinctions between celiac disease and other gluten related sensitivity disorders.\\\\nI have always been interested in studying Celiac disease. I always wanted to learn why and how it affects so many people. I also would not mind trying to find a cure for the disease.\\\\nI remember I had a friend during my first year of college who was very strict about avoiding foods containing any gluten at all. At first, I thought that she was avoiding foods containing gluten due to some sort of a diet fad or something of that nature. However, I later discovered that she was allergic to gluten and had suffered complications earlier in her life due to damage in her small intestine. I remember some of our mutual friends would be annoyed whenever we would want to eat certain items but she would always have us change our plans to eat something that was gluten free instead. I can thus relate to the article in that people who are allergic to gluten or have Celiac disease oftentimes feel isolated with limited options and with friends who are not interested in sharing gluten free meals with them. I think there should be a bigger push across college campuses to include more gluten free options that are enjoyable for both those who are unable to eat gluten and for their friends as well.\\\\nI also found it fascinating that the Reovirus is involved with Celiac disease induction. Another study has also described an association between Celiac disease and chronic Hepatitis C caused by the HCV virus (1). It will be interesting to see what other pathogens contribute to Celiac disease and what preventative measures (such as vaccines) can be employed to prevent the development of Celiac disease in the first place.\\\\nI agree with your comment; the school should have more gluten free options for some people.I didn\\\\u2019t know much about gluten when I was growing up. I used to hear commercials talking about gluten-free products, and I thought it was just that product that had gluten. It turns out most of the stuff we eat have gluten. It must be a real pain to have that allergic reaction. However new studies have alternative ways for Celiac disease treatment without avoiding gluten products. In a study done by Marino and his colleagues shows that modification of gliadin peptides inhibits their ability to induce an immune system response. This is done by using microbial transglutaminase for the change of the gliadin peptide. This is a good alternative, but there are some side effects we know about and some we don\\\\u2019t. Since this is relatively new, we don\\\\u2019t know long-term side effects. Eating gluten free products is the best choice.\\\\nI find this article to be very informative since I was not so familiar with celiac disease and how exactly it effects the human body. I have noticed a change in the food diets of our country that now normalizes gluten-free products. Just as the article mentioned, I inferred that gluten was another fad diet that was avoided by the general public to lose weight or become healthier. Though this study initially mentions it is mainly the presence of gluten itself that damages that lining of the small intestine, multiple studies have also included reovirus as being the cause for the immune confusion and eventual self-attacking episodes. The article Celiac Disease: Reovirus, Inflammatory Response, and Dietary Antigens agrees with the correlation between the reovirus and celiac disease and wanted to take studies further with a vaccine. Since there has been a vaccine made for celiac, their job was to test out the vaccine and see if there may have been an increased risk of actually developing the disease in children. However, after testing out a large amount of subjects throughout a five-year study, they did not see an increase in children with the vaccination than children without the vaccine. Though more trials may still need to be done as for the effectiveness of the vaccine against the virus, a negative correlation is currently not found.\\\\nI, too, was not aware of celiac disease and how many people it affects. I\\\\u2019m glad i got a chance to read about it, it opened my eye to something I\\\\u2019ve been so unaware about for so long. It\\\\u2019s refreshing ti know our country is making more and more gluten-free diets as this condition affects more and more people each year. It\\\\u2019s never easy living with an autoimmune disease, and it is very informative to know more research are being done about the causes and the possible correlation this disease has with the reovirus virus. Even possibly a vaccine for the disease.\\\\nThis post talk about how reovirus can trigger celiac disease by inducing the immune system to react to gluten. They also found out that there is higher level of reovirus antibody present in the patient with celiac disease compare with those who without the disease. Not all reovirus strains can trigger the autoimmune reaction. During their study, they found out that the ability of the strain to trigger the inflammatory immune response is depending on their genes since reovirus with different genes interact with the immune system differently. Autoimmune disease, especially inflammation of the digestive track, has been close linked to the viral or bacterial infection by many researches. Under normal condition, the intestinal mucosa is protected by the tight junction which limit the passage of the foreign antigen. Many of the research shows that certain kinds of virus or bacteria can modulate the intercellular tight junction and therefore, the intestinal mucosa permeability is increase. When the permeability is increase some foreign antigen such as gluten and other diary antigen can pass through the gut mucosal barrier and cause inflammation. The mechanism that those antigens trigger autoimmune reaction is called \\\\u201cmolecular mimicry\\\\u201d which microbial antigens are postulated to resemble self-antigen (1). I think that the reovirus play an important role in the \\\\u201cmolecular mimicry \\\\u201cmechanism of gluten. Once the autoimmune reaction is activated, it becomes independent of continue exposure to the environmental trigger and therefore self-perpetuating and irreversible (2) which means the autoimmune reaction cannot be shuttled off although the triggered antigen is being removed. Many of the inflammation bowel disease such as Crohn\\\\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis is triggered by the incontrollable immune system. Many people may ask why gluten consumption is very susceptible in triggering autoimmune reaction? The reason for this is that gluten is made up of gliadin and glutenins which contains many toxic epitopes that can exerting cytotoxic and other gut permeating activities. Celiac disease also has close genetic association with HLA genes which is a highly specific humoral autoimmune response against tissue transglutaminase auto-antigen (2). The present of gluten in the GI track also lead to upregulation of the zonulin which is the only physiologic modulator of intercellular tight junctions described so far that is involved in trafficking of macromolecules and, therefore, in tolerance/immune response balance (2) and people with acute celiac disease have higher level of zonulin. Therefore, gluten is very susceptible in triggering the autoimmune disease and I think that future study can be conducted to investigate the relationship between the reovirus infection and the zonulin pathway.\\\\nCeliac disease is one of many severe autoimmune diseases known to cause cancer cells. The fact that 2.5 million Americans are undiagnosed and risk complications due to long term exposure, indicates the urgency for intervention and development of vaccination. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) is a cell surface protein receptor for MHC class II antigen presenting cells. Gluten proteins, in the small intestine mucosa of patients infected with reovirus, readily binds HLA antigen DQ (HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8) with high affinity and activates T cell specific for gluten proteins that cause destruction of intestinal vili (1). Addison\\\\u2019s disease, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and Type 1 diabetes are examples of endocrine disorders that exhibit genes for HLA autoimmune response. Therefore, gluten proteins in reovirus infected patient, will cause celiac disease and may induce other HLA-linked diseases that is detrimental to our health.\\\\nCeliac disease is a severe genetic autoimmune disorder in which the gluten digestion leads to the small intestine being damaged. When people with is disease take in food with gluten, the body sees this as a foreign invader and sends a signal to the immune system, which attacks the small intestine. The only treatment available for people with this disease is a strict gluten-free diet. With more awareness being brought forth by this disease, it should also start the discussions about the many other autoimmune disorder relating to food or not. For example, pernicious anemia, the autoimmune condition in which the body absorption of B12 is flipped, resulting in a B12 deficiency (1). Of course, more studies can be done to get to the bottom line of why autoimmune exists in the first place. But in the case of celiac disease, it is an enormous progress that society is more aware and understanding of the importance of a gluten-free diet and making it more available.\"}\\n',\n",

It was (and still is) taken for granted by many Christadelphians that the Old Testament in particular was on solid grounds as a historically accurate text, backed by a wealth of evidence from Archaeology.\\\\nBut what does Archaeology actually tell us about the Bible today?\\\\nIn an interview conducted by NOVA, William Dever outlines his views on the history of Israel and how it relates to what the Bible claims. William Dever is a leading American archaeologist, specialising in the history of Israel and the Near East in Biblical times.\\\\nSo what does William Dever have to say about the state of Archaeology today with respect to the Bible?\\\\n\\\\\"The truth of the matter today is that archeology raises more questions about the historicity of the Hebrew Bible and even the New Testament than it provides answers, and that\\'s very disturbing to some people.\\\\\"\\\\nWas Israel ever in Egypt? Did they escape exactly as the Bible records?\\\\n\\\\\"The Bible chronology puts Moses much later in time, around 1450 B.C.E. Is there archeological evidence for Moses and the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of Israelites described in the Bible?\\\\nWe have no direct archeological evidence. \\\\\"Moses\\\\\" is an Egyptian name. Some of the other names in the narratives are Egyptian, and there are genuine Egyptian elements. But no one has found a text or an artifact in Egypt itself or even in the Sinai that has any direct connection. That doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t happen. But I think it does mean what happened was rather more modest. And the biblical writers have enlarged the story.\\\\nIs there mention of the Israelites anywhere in ancient Egyptian records?\\\\nNo Egyptian text mentions the Israelites except the famous inscription of Merneptah dated to about 1206 B.C.E. But those Israelites were in Canaan; they are not in Egypt, and nothing is said about them escaping from Egypt.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"One would have thought at that time that it was the end of the people of Israel\\\\u2014with elites carried away into captivity and ordinary people impoverished. It would have seemed to have been the end, but it was rather the beginning. Because it was in exile, precisely, that those who wrote the Bible looked back, collected the archives they had, rethought it all, reformulated it, and out of that intellectual reconstruction comes early Judaism.\\\\\"\\\\nThis interview was conducted by NOVA as part of a documentary on the origins of the Bible, titled \\\\\"The Bible\\'s Buried Secrets\\\\\".

It is a later legendary reconstruction\\\\u2014made in the seventh century [BCE]\\\\u2014of a history that never happened.\\\\u201d\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"John Garstang, who excavated in the 1930s, announced that he had found fallen walls dating to the time of the biblical Battle of Jericho. However, Garstang later revised the destruction to a much earlier period. Kathleen Kenyon dated the destruction of the walled city to the middle of the 16th century (c. 1550 BC), too early to match the Biblical story (assuming the traditional date), on the basis of her excavations in the early 1950s. The same conclusion, based on an analysis of all the excavation findings, was reached by Piotr Bienkowski. Kenyon\\'s dating was challenged by Bryant Wood in 1990, largely on the argument that Kenyon had misinterpreted the ceramic evidence. William Dever accused Wood of deceiving the public, while Bienkowski accused Wood of multiple errors, which Wood strenuously denied. In 1995, Bruins and var der Plicht announced radiocarbon dating of the city destruction to between 1617 and 1530 BC, agreeing with Kenyon.\\\\\"\\\\nI also found several other articles on clearly Christian websites that seem to agree with Bryant Wood with no hint that Wood might have been the one who was incorrect. I\\'m not sure if they just never bothered to look or if they were being intentionally dishonest.\\\\nHowever, as indicated in the above Wikipedia article, Bruins and van der Plicht confirmed the date of the destruction of Jericho to be in the 16th or 17th century, via radiocarbon dating of 18 samples taken from the site.\\\\n\\\\\"The final destruction of MBA Jericho occurred during the late 17th or the 16th century BC\\\\\"\\\\nI found a fascinating article published in the Smithsonian magazine that gives an interesting summary of Archaeology in Israel and how it relates to the Old Testament.\\\\nI\\'ve picked out some relevant paragraphs from the article, but I encourage you to read the whole article here.\\\\n\\\\\"Finkelstein and co-author Neil Asher Silberman rocked the world of biblical archaeology with the publication, five years ago, of The Bible Unearthed. The book argues that the biblical accounts of early Israelite history reveal more about the time they were written\\\\u2014the seventh century b.c.\\\\u2014than the events they describe, which would have taken place centuries earlier. The book also maintains that Israeli archaeologists have indulged in a kind of circular reasoning, drawing on biblical references to date a potsherd, for example, and then using it to identify places described in the Bible. The Bible, Finkelstein believes, should be used far more cautiously in interpreting archaeological sites.\\\\nHe cites the fact\\\\u2014now accepted by most archaeologists\\\\u2014that many of the cities Joshua is supposed to have sacked in the late 13th century b.c. had ceased to exist by that time. Hazor was destroyed in the middle of that century, and Ai was abandoned before 2000 b.c. Even Jericho, where Joshua is said to have brought the walls tumbling down by circling the city seven times with blaring trumpets, was destroyed in 1500 b.c. Now controlled by the Palestinian Authority, the Jericho site consists of crumbling pits and trenches that testify to a century of fruitless digging.\\\\nMore and more archaeologists have accepted the idea that \\\\u201cthe Joshua invasion as it is described in the Bible was never really a historical event,\\\\u201d as Amihai Mazar puts it. But they disagree about the exact nature and origins of those who built the ancient hilltop settlements on the West Bank.\\\\nEven more vexing is the question of a united kingdom under David and then Solomon. Trying to answer it has taken Finkelstein to the ruin of Megiddo, which most archaeologists once believed was the site of a palace King Solomon built sometime between 970 and 930 b.c.\\\\nFinkelstein also says that masonry marks and potsherds from the palace layer suggest that it must have been built around 850 b.c., in the time of Ahab\\\\u2014who \\\\u201cdid evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him,\\\\u201d according to I Kings. The so-called golden age of Solomon, Finkelstein goes on, is not supported by archaeological evidence. Rather, he says, it\\\\u2019s a myth concocted in the seventh century b.c. by the authors of Kings and Samuel to validate Judah\\\\u2019s expansion into the northern territory of Israel. Finally, Finkelstein says David never united the country; rather, Judah and Israel remained neighboring states. (The only non-biblical reference to David is found in a ninth-century b.c. inscription from Tel Dan, a biblical site in northern Israel that mentions \\\\u201cthe House of David.\\\\u201d Finkelstein says the inscription proves only that David existed, not that he united the kingdom.)\\\\\"\\\\nIsrael Finkelstein is not without his critics, and this is far from an open and shut case, but I think the evidence clearly shows that Archaeology does not prove that the Old Testament is historically accurate. Far from it.\\\\nThis is by no means an exhaustive look at archaeological evidence for the Old Testament. If you\\'re interested in the topic, you\\'ll be able to find much more information both online and in print than what I\\'ve listed above.\\\\nHowever, I did occasionally find it difficult to locate clear, unbiased sources with references to the various views on each topic. There are many Christian apologist websites out there claiming absolute certainty in a field where almost nothing is certain or beyond dispute. These websites clearly have an agenda, and thus the only people who will find them helpful are those looking for a comforting answer to their doubts, rather than those objectively searching for truth regardless of the outcome. Even a little bit of personal research will show you that there is a lot these websites are not telling you, and I leave you to question their motives for hiding critical information from their readers. For example, many such websites give detailed quotes from Bryant Wood regarding the chronology of the destruction of Jericho, but fail to mention the radiocarbon dating results that ultimately disconfirmed Wood\\'s hypothesis, as well as the views of his peers in the field.\\\\nDoes Archaeology confirm the reliability of the Old Testament?\\\\nOnly if you cherry-pick your sources and pretend no other sources exist. This would, of course, be dishonest.\\\\nIt seems that where a consensus exists among archaeologists, it is not in support of the Bible but rather contradicts it. When assessing other cases, pay special attention to the methodology used, and whether the archaeology took a back seat compared to the Bible. It seems obvious to me that if you\\'re using the Bible as a primary source to interpret the physical data then you cannot turn around and use that data as evidence supporting the Bible. That would be circular reasoning. You cannot trust the document that you are attempting to test or prove. And what we seem to find is that when less circular methods are used, the data does not in fact support the Bible.\\\\nThis is not to say that the Bible is an elaborate fiction invented from thin air. I do not believe the biblical authors necessarily wrote their works intentionally to deceive people. Rather I think what we have in the Bible is a reflection of how the scribes viewed their people and how they interpreted their history. The stories gave them meaning and purpose, and embodied their cultural identity. History in the ancient world was not considered to be unalterable documentation of what really happened. These were not works of impersonal, unbiased history reporting. Rather they were embellished accounts often incorporating legendary features and rich, imaginative story-telling, and sometimes revised over centuries. They captured the hearts and desires of anyone who had undergone oppression and trials, and described a very human passion for survival and success as a nation. Perhaps some elements were adapted from legends or stories passed down through generations. Perhaps a small group of slaves really did escape from Egypt and some of their stories were remembered and embellished. We will probably never know.\\\\nIn my view, the Bible tells a human story, not a divine one. It is not a book written to the ancient Israelites from an external source (i.e. by divine inspiration), but about them, by them, and for them. I think the Bible is a much more fascinating book when viewed as a collection of documents of purely human origin.\\\\nDiscrepancies and contradictions between the Bible and history, or between the Bible and scientific reality, do not need to diminish the value of these ancient sources of storytelling, wisdom (for its time), and poetry. Ironically, those who insist on the inerrancy and literal accuracy of the Bible from a historical or scientific perspective may well be the ones who bring it most into disrepute and thus invite people to disregard it entirely.\\\\nNatural disasters - why pray?\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"We check out the underrated AU Falcon XR8 range and Australia\\'s Windsor-powered limited editions.\\\\nWith the recent resurgence in the popularity of high-performance Ford vehicles, it\\'s only natural that previous models will now be looked back on in a new light. In Part One of this series we looked at the EB to EL Ford XR8s. This time we\\'ll check out the most powerful Windsor-powered machines \\\\u2013 the late-model AU Falcon XR8 and the various limited edition models.\\\\nFollowing the EB-EL shape XR8, Ford Australia introduced the all-new AU model in 1998.\\\\nThe AU Falcon copped plenty of flack about its innovative styling when released but, thankfully, the XR version managed to escape much of this criticism thanks to its more attractive quad headlight front-end. XR8s were also fitted with a subtle body kit and an optional bi-level rear spoiler, which is said to generate actual downforce \\\\u2013 it doesn\\'t merely reduce rear aero lift.\\\\nBut the biggest news in the AU Falcon was the long-awaited introduction of a double wishbone independent rear suspension. This \\\\u2013 combined with a host of other chassis and suspension changes \\\\u2013 gives the AU XR8 class-leading handling and stability. The standard wheel size is 16 inch but many buyers spent extra on 17s.\\\\nUnder its bonnet, the AU XR8 adopts a Windsor 5.0 that was said to be designed for the US-market Ford Explorer. This engine brought new heads, inlet manifold, camshaft and the EEC-V engine management was recalibrated to suit. Peak power remained pegged at 185kW but peak torque increases slightly to 412Nm (achieved at 5000 and 3500 rpm respectively).\\\\nFitted with either a revised 5 speed manual or 4 speed auto, the 1650-odd kilogram AU XR8 can accelerate to 100 km/h in the low 8 second range. The quarter mile takes a shade under 16.0 seconds.\\\\nFor the 2000 Series 2 version of the AU XR8, the faithful Windsor V8 was given another major revision.\\\\nStruggling to compete with Holden\\'s newly introduced 5.7 litre LS1 V8, Ford Australia gave the Windsor an upgrade to the tune of 200kW at 5000 rpm and 420Nm at 3650 rpm. This powerplant \\\\u2013 when backed with the base 5 speed manual gearbox \\\\u2013 delivers a LS1-beating launch but falls behind as road speed increases. The AUII XR8 can rip to 100 km/h in the low 7 second bracket and does the quarter mile thing in low 15s - not hanging around.\\\\nThe XR8 ute received the 200kW donk in early 2001.\\\\nTo cope with the extra speed, Ford offered standard dual-pot front brakes and an optional 329mm Premium brake package. Other options include leather, a high-end sound system and body kit. The body received less daring styling and the original AU XR8\\'s bi-level rear spoiler was dropped to make way for a conventional single element spoiler.\\\\nAnd just when you thought you\\'d seen everything the AU had to offer, the Series II was boosted to 220kW half way through its model run.\\\\nThe 220kW Windsor was hand-built by Tickford and features reengineered cast iron heads, a match-ported intake manifold, larger throttle body, ceramic coated headers and revised camshaft. Fuel pressure was also increased and the management system was recalibrated. Compression ratio had crept up to 9.4:1 \\\\u2013 still low enough to cope with normal unleaded fuel.\\\\nProducing 220kW at 5250 rpm and 435Nm at 4000 rpm, the late AUII XR8 is decidedly quick. In 5 speed manual guise, it can launch to 100 km/h in high 6s and run the quarter mile in high 14s.\\\\nThe final AU XR8 \\\\u2013 the AUIII \\\\u2013 appeared in late 2001 was available with the choice of a traditional XR appearance or a Ford Racing body kit. It was unaltered mechanically.\\\\nSecond-hand, these 220kW monsters fetch around $25 to $30 grand.\\\\nThe AUIII stepped aside for the BA series in late 2002.\\\\nFord Australia \\\\u2013 as opposed to its FTE division \\\\u2013 released only one limited edition of the AU XR8.\\\\nThe 2001 XR8 Rebel employs the same hand-built 220kW engine found in the late AUII XR8, 18 inch Speedline alloys, a Ford Racing body kit and \\\\u2013 wait for it \\\\u2013 a Sony PS2 for home use! A copy of Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec (signed by Glenn Seton and Steven Richards) was also thrown in on the deal.\\\\nWhat\\'s the point? Well, Sony included the FTR racecar in the vehicle line-up of GT3 and this is a \\'celebration\\'.\\\\nNot long after the release of the original EB-series XR8, Ford rekindled the glory days of old and released another Falcon GT.\\\\nThe 1992 25th Anniversary EB Falcon GT employs a heavily reworked Windsor 5.0 with big valve GT40 heads, hydraulic lifters, roller rockers, a high-flow intake manifold and throttle body, large diameter airflow meter and a recalibrated engine management system. This gave the EBII GT an even 200kW at 5200 rpm and 420Nm of torque at 4000 rpm.\\\\nIt was more than enough to take on HSVs from the same era.\\\\nThe EBII GT was available with a T5 5 speed featuring a heavy-duty Mustang Cobra gearset and upgraded bearings, while the optional 4 speed auto was a recalibrated BTR 85LE unit. The auto version uses a shorter diff ratio than the manual.\\\\nA comprehensive add-on aero kit, bigger brakes, improved suspension, 17 inch alloys and mega-dollar 235/40 Pirelli P Zero tyres give the EBII GT all-round talents to match its grunt. Its high price tag also meant full leather/timber trim, climate control and electric everything was essential.\\\\nUnfortunately, the \\'give it everything\\' approach contributed to a substantial 1646kg kerb weight. Combine this with doubts that the engine really made 200kW and it\\'s no surprise the EBII GT struggles to hit 100 km/h in 7.5 seconds. Auto versions took low 8s and around 16 seconds to run the quarter mile.\\\\nFord retrospectively admitted the Ford was built as a luxury express to satisfy men who had once owned GT Falcons of the \\'60s and \\'70s.\\\\nAn immaculate 1992 EB GT currently fetches around AUD$20,000 due to its collector appeal.\\\\nHot on the heels of the EBII GT was the ED XR8 Sprint \\\\u2013 a vehicle that offers virtually the same performance without all the hoo-ha.\\\\nThe XR8 Sprint is equipped with essentially the same engine as the EBII GT but, curiously, it is quoted with 8kW less. The Sprint is said to generate 192kW at 5000 rpm and 404Nm at 4000 rpm.\\\\nAlso available in 5 speed manual and 4 speed auto form, the cloth trimmed XR8 Sprint weighs almost 100kg less than the EBII GT and takes only 7.3 seconds to accelerate to 100 km/h. The quarter mile requires only 15.0 seconds of your time.\\\\nVisually, the XR8 Sprint received unique chunky-style 16 inch alloys and Sprint badges. The interior is standard ED XR8 fare with the addition of a Momo wheel.\\\\nAn ED XR8 Sprint currently costs around AUD$15,000 depending on kilometres and condition.\\\\nThe GT name was dusted off once again for the 1997 EL Falcon series.\\\\nThe EL GT \\\\u2013 which is based on the top-line Fairmont Ghia \\\\u2013 is equipped with a total of 11 stick-on body parts and an integrated bonnet vent. The look is, well, controversial but unarguably attention-getting... At least the rear spoiler is effective \\\\u2013 it is said to reduce rear axle lift by a massive 70 percent.\\\\nBehind its vertical barred grille are a pair of air intake scoops, which ram induction air into a free-flow induction system. The intake manifold was also swapped for a mandrel bent tubular set-up with a 65mm throttle body. The heads are cast-iron GT40 items with 2mm oversize inlet valves and providing a 9.0:1. compression ratio. Interestingly, the cam profile is identical to that used in the cooking model Windsor but increased valve lift is achieved through the use of 1.7:1 roller rockers (instead of conventional 1.6:1 units). Exhaust gasses pulse through 4>1 headers, twin cat converters and dual mufflers.\\\\nThe EL GT\\'s quoted power output is 200kW at 4700 rpm and it has 420Nm of torque at 3700 rpm. There\\'s no doubting its power and torque figures, but its limited rev range is far from sporting.\\\\nThe live axle suspension is retuned while 17 inch wheels, 329mm front discs and twin-spot calipers come standard. The cabin is decked out with leather trim, wood inlays, a Momo wheel, 240 km/h speedo and all the power luxuries Ford had available. This, like the EBII GT, adds weight and the EL GT tips the scales at 1668kg.\\\\nAs a result, its straight-line performance is nothing astounding \\\\u2013 0 \\\\u2013 100 km/h in the mid 7s and the quarter takes mid 15s.\\\\nPrice wise, an EL GT costs a bit more than a comparable EBII GT \\\\u2013 up to around AUD$25,000 for one in collector\\'s condition.\\\\nDuring the AU Series 1 timeframe, Ford\\'s newly formed FTE division released the T-series.\\\\nThe 1999 TE50 and Fairlane-based TL50 were the first AU models to use a 200kW version of the Windsor. The 200kW output was achieved using a more aggressive camshaft, aluminium roller rockers and bigger induction piping. Peak power arrives at 5000 rpm while peak torque \\\\u2013 420Nm \\\\u2013 can be reached at 3750 rpm.\\\\nMarketed alongside the TE and TL50 was the mid-spec TS50, which boasted a full 220kW and 435Nm. Further camshaft development, big valve aluminium heads, a flow-matched GT40-type intake manifold, bigger throttle body, upgraded exhaust manifolds and cat converters and increased fuel pressure are required to achieve the 220kW output. Compression ratio remains at a mild 9.0:1. Note that both power and torque arrive at higher revs \\\\u2013 peak power is at 5250 rpm and peak torque is at 4000 rpm. Unfortunately, much of the Windsor\\'s previous refinement has been lost \\\\u2013 the 220kW TS50 has a lumpy idle, which is a tell-tale sign of its relatively hot cam.\\\\nAn electronic sports shift auto transmission \\\\u2013 with buttons on the steering wheel \\\\u2013 was standard for the first time in the TS and TL50 and was optional on the TE50.\\\\nBoth TE and TS50s employ 329 x 28mm front discs with Cobra Mustang calipers. The discs are grooved and the master cylinder is modified to suit. The independent suspension systems of each are improved over the XR8. TS and TL50s also employ Koni dampers and traction control. Unique 17 inch alloys and 235/45 tyres come fitted to the TE, while the TS50 and TL50 use 18s with 245/40s.\\\\nA chrome mesh grille, colour-coded headlight bezels and other subtle body touches give the TE-series their own look. Interiors are also upgraded, with the TE50 having sports fabric trim and the TS and TL50s having leather. A Momo wheel comes standard.\\\\nWell, high 6 second 0 \\\\u2013 100s are typical for the manual 220kW TS50. TL50 autos take about 7.5 seconds.\\\\nWhen the Falcon AUII upgrade came along, the T-series received some important revisions.\\\\nThe 200kW engine was dropped so the TE/TS and TL50 were now standard with 220kW/435Nm. A manual gearbox was also available on the TE and TS50s. Mechanically, the AUII T-series vehicles were given a revised cam profile, SVO alloy heads and recalibrated engine management to provide improved bottom-end performance. The big 329mm brake package was also made standard on TS and TL50s and optional on the TE50.\\\\nOther engineering changes made to the AUII range apply to the T-series and there are other minor trim and detail changes. It appears that buyers wanted a greater variety of colours and styling options \\\\u2013 not everyone wanted a subtle look.\\\\nAnd now for what is the ultimate Windsor engine development \\\\u2013 the Australian-built 5.6 litre stroker.\\\\nFor late 2001, FTE released the hairy-chested T3 range of TE, TS and TL50s.\\\\nThe T3s share the same under-bonnet monster \\\\u2013 a 5.6 litre stroked Windsor. The big-cube motor is hand-built with a new crankshaft, ported GT40P iron heads with hi-po springs and valves, billet rods, lightweight 9.6:1 pistons, revised cam, 82mm throttle body, unique high-flow intake manifold and a conical air filter with a dedicated airflow meter.\\\\nTry 250kW at 5250 rpm and a monster 500Nm at 4250 rpm!\\\\nIt\\'s no surprise these machines \\\\u2013 despite weighing over 1700kg - can rip to 100 km/h in around 6.0 seconds in Tremec 5 speed manual form. The spread of torque and throttle responsive is also very strong. Just don\\'t expect a huge amount of refinement \\\\u2013 the 5.6 shakes around at idle and suffers excess vibration at high revs.\\\\nBased on the AU Series III, the T3s feature a heavy-duty Dana M78 LSD, 355mm front discs with 4 pot Brembos, 18 inch wheels and an aggressive body kit on TE/TS50 models. Note that a 5.6 litre FTE Pursuit 250 ute was also released.\\\\nWe\\'ve seen early 200kW TE50s appear for sale from AUD$25,000 while 5.6 litre TS50s nudge AUD$45,000.\\\\nThe stroker T3s go into the history books as the undisputed king of Aussie Windsor performance. The only other Ford V8 that\\'s managed to upstage them is the current DOHC beast 5.4 in the BA-series.\"}\\n',\n",

They thought that somebody with epileptic seizures were possessed by demons and they found if they take these people and shut them in a room without food, the demons would disappear.\\\\nWhat happened was that through the fast, blood ketone body level went up and suppressed the seizures.\\\\nNowadays, fasting and the ketogenic diet is used to treat epilepsy.\\\\nFor most people fasting is not just a way of preventing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\\'s but also to boost the brain and when it comes to boosting the brain, the most studied protein in this field is the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor.\\\\nBDNF itself is important for learning, long-term memory, and plays a role in neurogenesis, which is the new formation of neurons.\\\\nThe explanation the research group provides is that the higher increase was seen when they took very specific parts of the brain regions. Parts were they thought neurogenesis is happening and therefore BDNF levels should be increased.\\\\nChronic inflammation is another risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. A molecule that is used to initiate inflammatory reactions in laboratory settings is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It is a molecule found at the cell wall of bacteria and usually it should not be inside our blood stream. However, if you have a severe infection or a condition called leaky gut, bacteria rush into your blood and induce strong immune reactions.\\\\nThere are ways to protect your body from inflammation and besides keeping your microbiome healthy, intermittent fasting seems to be very powerful tool to reduce inflammation levels in the body.\\\\nA research group from Sao Paulo found that that Intermittent fasting attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation and memory impairment . The scientist placed rats on an alternate day feeding schedule and injected them with LPS, which led to memory impairment in the control rat group on a normal feeding schedule but was prevented through IF. They found that IF actually reduced the levels of inflammatory proteins in the brain of the rats and that it prevents (LPS)-induced depletion of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor.\\\\nIt is like exercise for the brain. If you work out, it is also a stress for your muscles, which tells them to become stronger.\\\\nOne of the leading hypothesis in this field is that the ability to think more efficient and become more clear minded when not having food, gave the early human a survival benefit.

The first race, in 1982, was organised by Barry Devereux, a Rotary Club member and a keen runner.\\\\nThe race grew gradually, reaching a total of 270 runners in 2000, and over the past 15 years it has grown more than five-fold, with some 1,500 runners taking part in 2014.\\\\nThis year, with the five mile race doubling as both the Herts Vets County Championships and the Schools Challenge, the Rotary Club could find that every single one of the 1,750 medals are placed around a finisher\\\\u2019s neck.\\\\nWork starts on the event eight months ahead of time, with the Rotary organisers meeting in July each year to begin planning.\\\\nPeter Robertson, who has been involved with the race for 20 years and race director for the last 14 editions, reckons that more than 500 hours are devoted to the process.\\\\nOn top of this, more than 180 volunteers give up their time on race day \\\\u2013 ranging from Rotarians and their friends and family, the local Lions Club, friends of the Pepper Foundation and the Hospice of St Francis, and local ATC cadets and officers.\\\\nAnd every year, the race gets better; chief marshal John Simpson points out that this year\\\\u2019s race will have a group warm-up at the start area before the half marathon kicks off.\\\\nThere will also be two extra water stations, a slight improvement to the course which will take the runners down Castle Street, and the option to buy a souvenir race T-shirt for the first time.

Did I really? Must\\\\u2019ve been when we were talking about HR lottery?\\\\nGreat interview guys! Blake Wood is a super interesting guy! Sarah, thanks for asking the HRH gender question.\\\\nSorry you had to read that, Sarah. Let it go. I\\\\u2019m fully with you on the gender imbalance issue. Unless they somehow alter the lottery it\\\\u2019s not going ot be fixed, and it\\\\u2019s a shame. Blake was not particularly convincing downplaying the uneven ratio. The percentage of women drawn from the lottery is significantly lower than the already low percentage of women participating in the lottery. It shows you the procedure is flawed. They can\\\\u2019t pretend they are being gender neutral \\\\u2014 they know all too well that the veteran preference systematically disadvantages women.\\\\nThank god we didn\\\\u2019t get served the usual \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s a run, not a race\\\\u201d BS.\\\\nSarah, Rachel, Nick, etc. Help me understand what you want to see happen at Hardrock. Change in the lottery? If so, how? Do you want places set aside? How many? Serious questions that I don\\\\u2019t know the answer to.\\\\nI don\\\\u2019t think there are any easy answers, and smart people have already debated this at length. What I\\\\u2019d like to see is a critical mass of women (more than 15 \\\\u2013 20ish each year) running it so it\\\\u2019s a more interesting event (whether you call it a run or race, it\\\\u2019s a race to me) to spectate, and to see how women do when they test themselves against the course and against each other. Seeing the same gals (e.g. Betsy, Betsy, Diana, Anna, Darcy)\\\\u2014for whom I have huge respect and like as people\\\\u2014run it each year again and again just isn\\\\u2019t that interesting from a competitive standpoint. I cheered out loud when I saw that both Hannah Green (winner & CR holder of Telluride Mtn Run) and Katie Grossman got drawn for this year because I\\\\u2019m excited to see how they do. I\\\\u2019m not gender blind, though I like following the guys\\\\u2019 races; the women\\\\u2019s field matters to me and interests me athletically, as a spectator and for inspiration and role models. So, I think there\\\\u2019s a legit argument to be made to add a handful of spots specifically for women to make the women\\\\u2019s field more robust and closer to the percentage that applies to the lottery. I appreciated hearing Blake\\\\u2019s perspective on why they maintain the veterans\\\\u2019 advantage, to keep it like a family reunion. But it sounds like there is wiggle room to add some more spots. As for the very real issue of overcrowding at aid stations and in the gymnasium during the post-race celebration, I suspect (though perhaps they\\\\u2019ve already tried this) they could do more to limit the number of crew/pacers invited. Bottom line: I\\\\u2019d like to see more open conversation on this topic, and that\\\\u2019s why I asked those questions in the interview, because I\\\\u2019ve heard other women raise them. There seems to be a \\\\u201cdon\\\\u2019t rock the boat\\\\u201d feeling around Hardrock and fear of talking openly about the lottery mechanics because everyone wants to be good natured and supportive (as do I!). Talking openly can be done in a constructive, respectful way. That\\\\u2019s my more-than-two-cents! Meanwhile, I\\\\u2019ll enjoy pacing & crewing & volunteering at an aid station and possibly helping iRF again with their coverage. It\\\\u2019s a magical event, and I don\\\\u2019t want that magic lost.\\\\nAlso, I went through and tried to count the number of women among this year\\\\u2019s 145 entrants (not easy to do because \\\\u201cM\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cF\\\\u201d is not listed with names, and some names are gender neutral) so I may have counted wrong but it looks like 22 (about 15%). There are some exciting first-time Hardrock women in the field this year, in addition to the ones I mentioned above: past UTMB champs Nathalie Mauclair & Caroline Chaverot.\\\\nI enjoyed the interview and especially putting Blake on the spot with some tough questions. I do wish you asked about the hetty \\\\u201celse\\\\u201d pool advantage. If a \\\\u201cnever\\\\u201d happens to get picked for the race, assuming they finish, the following year they enter the \\\\u201celse\\\\u201d pool with a huge advantage to get in. I sort of get the reasons the vets get in, ok, they built the race, etc. But why extend the advantage for those who are are not vets?\\\\n1. use Dale\\\\u2019s picks to increase competitive nature of woman\\\\u2019s race (and I think they are doing this: Mauclair and Chaverot are almost certainly Dale\\\\u2019s picks, and I\\\\u2019d bet good money Grossman is as well.\\\\n2. Increase the number of slots \\\\u2013a handful each year\\\\u2013 upwards to 200. It\\\\u2019s a slow 100 mile loop race. Even with 225 it won\\\\u2019t feel like UTMB or Leadville. I\\\\u2019m sure someone can figure out the logistics for the post race breakfast.\\\\n4. DNF\\\\u2019s in all pools have to sit out the lottery for a year.\\\\n5. Promote a solo division (no pacer, no crew) with a slight advantage in the respective pools to get cars off the mountain roads.\\\\nLoved the interview. I want to be Blake Wood when I grow up. A 2:43 at age 52 plus 20 Hardrock finishes? Incredible.\\\\nI\\\\u2019m appreciative Blake opened up about the Hardrock lottery but I gotta say, the 3 reasons were not very convincing.\\\\nProblem #1 and #2 could easily be solved, right?\\\\nI hate to be a pessimist but the real reason appears to be #3. They simply want to keep the race small.\\\\nAnd they certainly can do this if they want since it\\\\u2019s their race. It\\\\u2019s just a bummer to hear they have the permits for 80 more runners each year. That would help so much and give so many runners the chance to complete a lifelong dream.\\\\n145 slots 1900 applicants , I\\\\u2019d like to see more women in too , by all means volunteer at this race , humble your ambition to run this magnificent 100 ..

She was a poor Tobacco farmer and mother of five. The silver lining behind the tragic life of Henrietta Lacks was the discovery of arguably the greatest scientific breakthrough in medical history, the first immortal cell line. We will discuss the implications of such a discovery shortly. But first, let\\'s delve into the humbling story of Henrietta Lacks and the legacy she left behind.\\\\nOne of the greatest biological hurdles of that era was the inability to cultivate cells in vitro (outside of a living body) for a long enough period of time, at least not long enough to yield meaningful scientific research. Human cells are confined by the Hayflick limit. That is to say, cells in culture will divide an average of 50 times before they reach cellular senescence, a permanent state of growth arrest. This predicament hindered growth and research in countless areas of science.\\\\nTo Dr. Gey\\'s outstanding surprise, and complete disbelief, Lacks\\' cells divided indefinitely. It was concluded that Lacks\\' cell line was immortal, a true mystery. Following that revelation, Dr. Gey shipped Lacks\\' cell samples around the world. The scientific potential was powerful and the opportunities presented were unprecedented. Forward, Lacks\\' cells were referred to as \\\\\"HeLa Cells\\\\\" (short for her name).\\\\nImmediately, the worlds first cell production facility began producing 6 trillion HeLa cells per week. As Henrietta Lacks lay dying, came our miracle. October 4, 1951 Henrietta Lacks succumbed to cancer, never knowing about a fortune that was rightfully hers.\\\\nHer cells spawned unimaginable scientific oppurtunity. We decoded the human chromosome, developed gene mapping, better understood bacteria, hormones, viruses (like polio), help treat diseases (like Herpes, Parkinson\\'s, AIDS), helped treat cancel, jumpstarted cloning, genetics and various forms of radiation treatments. Eleven thousand medical patents have been awarded as a direct consequence of HeLa cells.\\\\nIt was not long till HeLa cells caught the attention of the media. John Hopkins was questioned to which patient these cells originated from. He attempted to throw off the media by providing the misleading name of Helene Lane. Might I say, not a very creative cover.\\\\nIn 1976, after 25 years of deception and lies, Rolling Stone magazine published the true story. That is when Lacks\\' family found out about Henrietta Lacks\\' amazing contribution. Despite living in poverty, all her family requested was that credit should be given to Henrietta Lacks for her dying contribution for all of mankind.\\\\nBecause of Henrietta Lacks death in 1951, we are fortunate to spend time with the people we love today. Thank you Henrietta.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of bioactive chemical once used in industrial applications, but which now contaminate the world environment. PCBs are lipophilic with few natural degadatory mechanisms, and thus they accumulate in human and animal tissues, and are passed to subsequent generations via transfer between mother and offspring. Research has shown that PCBs can interfere with brain and sexual organ development, and adult sexual behaviors and reproduction. However, previous studies produced contradictory results based on the dose and method of administration, species, and the age at exposure. The research detailed in this thesis elucidates the effects of prenatal exposure to low levels of a commercial mixture of PCBs, Aroclor (A) 1221, on female reproductive function. The studies undertaken in this dissertation focus on three areas relevant to understanding long-term effects of PCBs on reproductive physiology in female rats: (1) developmental effects in two generations, (2) sexual behaviors in the first generation, and (3) gene expression in the first generation. In the first research section of this dissertation, the sexual and somatic development of PCB-exposed animals is investigated in first (F1) and second (F2) generation females. Dose-dependent effects are observed in both generations, and a greater number of endpoints are significantly affected in the F2, including circulating hormone levels and uterine and ovarian weight. The second research section of the dissertation explores whether sexual behaviors in the first generation of exposed animals are altered by A1221, using a paced mating paradigm designed to elucidate female-typical behaviors. Several salient behaviors are affected by PCB exposure, including likelihood to mate, mating trial pacing, and stress-related vocalizations. The third research chapter discusses the results of a genomewide microarray assay performed on the preoptic area of the brain. The preoptic area is a neuroendocrine control center implicated in regulation of reproductive physiology and behavior. Taken together, these results suggest that A1221 has long lasting and trans-generational effects on the development and behavior of exposed females, accompanied by altered gene expression in a neuroendocrine region of the brain. These findings have implications for female reproductive health and reproductive success in wildlife and humans.\"}\\n',\n",

The toxic spill killed ten people, injured over 200, destroyed 358 homes, wiped out all life in two small rivers and polluted over 1,000 hectares of land. Many of those who came in contact with the highly alkaline substance suffered severe burns and 120 people needed hospitalisation after the flood.\\\\nIn the disaster, over 700 people suffered material damage and a total of 35 billion forints (EUR 118m) was spent from the central budget on compensations and reconstruction.\\\\nMarking the anniversary, spokeswoman Eva Kurucz said in a video message posted on the government\\\\u2019s website that four years ago Hungary\\\\u2019s worst ecological disaster caused by industrial activity had occurred.\\\\nShe emphasised that thanks to exemplary cooperation, the villages affected by the disaster could again come to life and undergo development.\\\\nKurucz noted beside the government\\\\u2019s assistance in rebuilding the local infrastructure and financial support to affected families the efforts of hundreds of thousands of experts and civilian volunteers on reconstruction, social and health care work, as well as on rebuilding local communities and reviving social life.\\\\nZoltan Gogos, the deputy leader of the opposition Socialists, said that four years after the disaster no proper account had been given to those many people who had contributed donations from across the country on how exactly the total of 2 billion forints raised had been spent.\\\\nThe small green LMP party demanded clarification of the scopes of responsibility in the disaster, assessment of consequences and reasonable compensation for families of the victims.\\\\nRadical nationalist Jobbik demanded the immediate punishment of those responsible for the disaster and said the state should cover court costs related to the event.\"}\\n',\n",

In a series that sits with a series of albums including The Quietened Village, The Quietened Bunker and The Quietened Cosmologists that have focused on abandoned villages, derelict Cold War infrastructure and the lost dreams of the space race, Mechanisms sits strongly, a soaring soundbite of seismic and sensory sounds.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt wanders amongst deserted factories\\\\u201d our friends at A Year In The Country tell We Are Cult: \\\\u201cDiscarded machinery, closed mines, mills and kilns and their echoes and remains; taking a moment or two to reflect on these once busy, functioning centres of activity and the sometimes sheer scale or amount of effort and human endeavour that was required to create and operate such structures and machines, many of which are now just left to fade away\\\\u201d.\\\\nAs with the albums of Eno and Vangelis, it is through the use of synths that listeners are brought back to the realm of nature. Quaker\\\\u2019s Stang play a keyboard of controlled challenge, Keith Seatman brings ambient aggression on a Rural Flight. This is one of the most arresting A Year In The Country releases yet. It\\\\u2019s definitely one of the best!\\\\nThrough sounds of aural and dystopic unease, tape loops and keyboards introduce listeners to the buzzing and humming an industrial factory makes. Drum patterns pedal over growls and loops tick time through the waves of weary wordless wages. Text notes write about shut down factories and empty machinery in a piece more potent than prose. There\\\\u2019s an irony to this album that deliciously shows how technology and industry has alienated society as much as it has developed it. Such Floydian irony sits well with this reviewer, and with the absence of a new Roger Waters drama, this substitutes just fine.\\\\nThe Quietened Mechanisms is wonderfully and weirdly avant-garde in presentation and representation. Layered in subtext, folkloric rhetoric and ironic resonance, the album is as much an invitation into the listener\\\\u2019s psyche as it is into the artist\\\\u2019s repartee. The album takes growth from the trees around Britain, as Embertides sing with Celtic ambience over a rise of showery synths. Depatterning echo through sounds hypnotic and hairy. A snore wakes up listeners for an introduction. One track boasts its recording as sound of two vintage Revox tape recorders passing a single tape loop backwards and forwards. A church bell tolls with the deafened defence Phil Spector used on Plastic Ono Band. Among all that, Rattler To The Tower sounds enjoyably commercial; were some lyrics added, it might make a radio hit!\\\\nPut in place as a newly, eerily insular look at the world around us, there is a sense that this is a work that is unwaveringly and unmannerly in description.

It was tipped to be launched on 19th of May but the launch was rescheduled to 31st May instead. The YU Yunicorn is a mid-range phone which will give a direct competition to the the phones between 15K-20K. We have been playing with the new entrant from last week and here are the answers to some really important queries about the device.\\\\nAnswer- The YU Yunicorn looks looks quite different compared to the previous phones from YU Televentures. Front has 2.5D curve glass and a fingerprint sensor at the bottom that looks exactly the same as Mezu m3 Note. The back is made up of metal with brushed finish and has slight curve on the sides. The top and bottom of the back is made up of plastic to place the antennae bands but they are finished like metal. There are two thin shiny stripes where the aluminum back is joint with the antennae bands, which looks good, and the back also has chamfered edges that make it look even more elegant.\\\\nIt feels very solid and heavy in hand, and looks premium for sure. But the design looks borrowed from Meizu phones, specially the front and the camera at the back.\\\\nQuestion- Does the YU Yunicorn Have Dual SIM Slots?\\\\nAnswer- Yes, it has a Hybrid dual SIM slot and supports nano SIM.\\\\nQuestion- Does the YU Yunicorn Have microSD Expansion option?\\\\nAnswer- Yes, you can insert a micro SD card up to 128GB in the SIM 2 slot.\\\\nQuestion- Does YU Yunicorn Have Display Glass Protection?\\\\nAnswer- It comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.\\\\nQuestion- How is the Display of the YU Yunicorn?\\\\nAnswer- The YU Yunicorn comes with a 5.5 inch Full HD (1920 X 1080 pixels) IPS display protected with 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The display looks very subtle and clear. Colours were looking punchy and the sharpness is also perfect. Viewing angles are good but the glass is a bit reflective under bright day light.\\\\nQuestion- Does YU Yunicorn Support Adaptive Brightness?\\\\nAnswer- It comes with the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with the YU AOS on top.\\\\nAnswer- Yes, it has a fingerprint sensor and it is baked in the home button, and it is very quick.\\\\nQuestion- Can Apps be moved to SD card on YU Yunicorn?\\\\nAnswer- It does not have any bloatware pre loaded.\\\\nAnswer- It has a good loudspeaker, it was fairly loud for a small hall or room.\\\\nQuestion- What is the weight of the YU Yunicorn?\\\\nAnswer- It weighs 173 grams.\\\\nQuestion- How much storage is free on first boot?\\\\nAnswer- 25.24 GB is free out of 32 GB on first boot.\\\\nQuestion- How much RAM was available at user end after first boot?\\\\nAnswer- 2.9 GB of RAM was free when we switched on the device for the first time.\\\\nQuestion- How good is The Camera Quality of the YU Yunicorn?\\\\nAnswer- It comes with a 13 MP camera on the back and 5 MP on the front. Primary camera performs decent in day light but as we moved to low light, it was literally suffering. It has stabilization issues, focus speed is below average and details were also not up to the mark. The front camera captures clear selfies in natural light, but it becomes difficult to get a clear selfie in artificial light. The camera is very shaky and camera UI is laggy.\\\\nQuestion- Can it record slow motion videos?\\\\nAnswer- Yes it can record slow motion videos.\\\\nQuestion- Can we Play Full HD 1080p Videos on YU Yunicorn?\\\\nQuestion- How is Battery Backup on YU Yunicorn?\\\\nAnswer- It comes with a 4000 mAh battery, and such a juicy battery is great for any phone with such hardware configurations. It\\\\u2019ll easily last more than a day on single charge. Yu claims the phone to last for 18 hours with continuous usage.\\\\nQuestion- What Color Variants are Available for YU Yunicorn?\\\\nAnswer\\\\u2013 It will be available in Rush Gold, Graphite and Rush Silver coloured variants.\\\\nQuestion- Can we set the display colour temperature on YU Yunicorn?\\\\nQuestion- Is there any in-built power saver in the YU Yunicorn?\\\\nAnswer- Yes, it has power saving mode to improve the battery efficiency.\\\\nQuestion- Which Sensors are available on YU Yunicorn?\\\\nAnswer- It has Gyroscope, Light sensor, Proximity sensor, Fingerprint sensor, Magnetometer, Gravity sensor and Accelerometer.\\\\nQuestion- What is the SAR Value of YU Yunicorn?\\\\nAnswer- SAR value is still unknown.\\\\nQuestion- Does it has fast charging?\\\\nAnswer- No it does not support fast charging.\\\\nQuestion- Does YU Yunicorn Have Heating Issues?\\\\nQuestion- Can YU Yunicorn be connected to a Bluetooth Headset?\\\\nYU Yunicorn is a really good device for someone who demands a lot of multitasking from their phones. It has everything that you can demand at this price point, but this deal could have been sweeter if the software was on point. It comes with almost stock Android Lollipop, and a very ordinary set of camera, but everything else is great for the price.\"}\\n',\n",

For anyone over 21, the hourly rate rises by 19p to \\\\u00a36.50. For 18 to 20 year old employees the rise is 10p to reach \\\\u00a35.13 an hour. For those in work at the age of 16 or 17, it is 7p, making their minimum wage per hour \\\\u00a33.79, although youngsters only become eligible for this on the last Friday in June of the year in which they become 16.\\\\nNow that some form of education is compulsory until the age of 18, 16 and 17 year olds can only be employed if they are also undergoing some part time education or training as well. You might have one or more young people on apprenticeships with you, in which case their minimum hourly wage rises by 5p to \\\\u00a32.73. As your outsourced bookkeepers will know, after apprentices\\' first year, the rate remains at this level for those under 19, while those over 19 must receive the same rate as other employees in their age group.\\\\nFailure to comply with these regulations can evoke some hefty penalties, and these become even more severe on October 1st. Where currently the maximum fine that could be imposed is \\\\u00a35,000 per employee, it is set to go up to \\\\u00a320,000, which will add up to a significant total if several workers are involved.\\\\nHMRC have powers to investigate employers at any time if they have received a complaint or have reasons to suspect non-compliance. They can request pay records for up to the previous three years.\\\\nYou are advised to get your bookkeepers to check the payroll and ensure that all your employee records are up to date, especially those for young people whose rates could have changed on their birthdays. Rules for what can be excluded when calculating the minimum wage can be complicated and many employers have fallen foul of the regulations because they were not known or understood. Outsourced bookkeepers keep up to date on all these aspects, so make sure you discuss the changes with them before the end of the month.\\\\nIf you discover that anyone has been underpaid, pay the arrears straight away to demonstrate that it was just a mistake and you have acted in good faith. That way, you may be able to avoid the heavy financial penalties that can be imposed where employers deliberately flout the rules.\"}\\n',\n",

It is certain that you are eagerly looking forward to a moving to Spain guide to help you start a new life there. You need to truly plan your entire project of moving to Spain so that the process becomes a smooth and successful transition.\\\\nThe moving to Spain checklist must indeed be a long and detailed one. Let us first decide where we are going to settle after moving to Spain. Southern Spain with its world class infrastructure and the finest quality living is an excellent place to set up home.\\\\nHaving decided the place, let us move on to the next item in the moving to Spain checklist. Now we need to have a clear and concise picture of the most important things to know before moving to Spain. Our next area of decision will involve if you need to rent a place or buy one on moving to Spain. If you choose to rent a place, it might give you the added advantage of getting familiarized with the atmosphere and the surrounding neighborhood before you think of buying property in Spain. You need not rush to take any hasty decision on buying. On moving to Spain you may assess the basic facilities like shopping, transportation, safety etc. and then go ahead with your purchase of property.\\\\nThe next very important item in the moving to Spain checklist is about healthcare. This is something that requires planning in advance before moving to Spain. Find out about your healthcare entitlements in Spain. It is very much advised that you take up private health care as the first and foremost step in your process of moving to Spain.\\\\nTaking the next place in the moving to Spain checklist is schools and colleges. If you have children of school going age, it is best to do some research on the various schooling possibilities before moving to Spain. After taking major decisions like is it going to be Spanish or an International School, you may contact them on the internet itself for their prospectus and application forms.\\\\nA basic element that cannot be ignored in your moving to Spain checklist is the knowledge of the local language. You might find English being spoken in many places but it gives you great advantage in knowing the basic phrases commonly used and your communication becomes very smooth.\\\\nYour moving to Spain checklist should definitely include the idea of own transportation. There is no doubt that public transportation system is an excellent one in Spain. However, mobility levels increase if you have your own mode of transport. You will also be able to explore the areas to your convenience.\\\\nPets take up an important place in the moving to Spain guide. Pets traveling in Europe need to fulfill certain health requirements. You need to make sure that you pet is allowed to move with you to Spain. Acquiring an EU Pet Passport may be a long process. So prepare for this much in advance.\\\\nFood occupies a place of great importance in your moving to Spain checklist. You need to be prepared to face the different cuisines on moving to Spain. Acquaint your self with the different cuisines available in Spain. The food shopping you will be able to do in Spain is totally a different experience and you need to be prepared. It is said that you very rarely get ready-made foods in Spain. Everything is preferred fresh here. On doing a little bit of research you will be able to identify the places where you could get fresh fruits, vegetable and groceries at the best rates.\\\\nDo not forget to include money matters in your moving to Spain checklist. It is advisable to open a Spanish Bank Account. Before opening the account you need to procure your foreigners\\\\u2019 identification number from the nearest police station in Spain. This document is very important for all legal and monetary procedures in Spain. On moving to Spain, this must take your utmost priority.\\\\nYou also need to have an idea of the taxation system prevalent in the country. Resident or non-resident system of taxation is in vogue. Have an idea of the various types of tax deductions available before moving to Spain.\\\\nCost of living as a whole entity occupies a place of great significance in your moving to Spain checklist. Have a clear idea of all the major heads if expense including utility services like power, water, fuel, home groceries, eating out, education, medical health etc. This will equip you with great confidence on starting your new life in Spain.\\\\nAssess the information collected and take an independent decision. Just always remember to make a confident beginning even before landing the soil of another country so that life there begins on a happy and successful note. Hopefully, this moving to Spain guide will help you jump start your preparations.\"}\\n',\n",

But even more thrilled and humbled by the work that her many fans must have put in to nominate her for her service to sports administration over 64 years, including lawn bowls.\\\\nHer fans must have been lining up to get a piece of the nominee action. So much has been her influence on lawn bowlers in Northland, and for that matter, the rest of New Zealand. That\\\\u2019s without even considering her lifetime of voluntary work in sports including netball, marching, softball and basketball, and in community organisations like Solo Parents.\\\\nGwen has not only been there, done that when it comes to voluntary service \\\\u2026 but is still being there, doing that coming up to the age of 80.\\\\n\\\\u201cLawn bowls is my great love,\\\\u201d says Gwen, \\\\u201cbut it wasn\\\\u2019t my first love. I joined marching when I was just 8, and I was on the marching Association Committee by the age of 15.\\\\u201d Gwen found herself being a marcher, an instructor, and a qualified judge for the New Zealand Marching Association from 1960, as well as New Zealand Association Treasurer from 1992 to 1994.\\\\nIn the 50s and 60s she became involved in netball. Like marching, netball was about more than just playing the game. Gwen ended up as Association President for Netball from 1960 to 1962 and an Umpire for Netball New Zealand for 30 years from 1954 to 1985. In 1979, the Northern Advocate described Gwen as a \\\\u2018pillar of North netball\\\\u2019.\\\\nLawn bowls didn\\\\u2019t come in to her life until 1972, when a girlfriend talked her in to having a go at the Hikurangi Bowling Club, a few miles north of Whangarei. \\\\u201cI loved it,\\\\u201d says Gwen. And the 46 year association with lawn bowls and the Hikurangi Bowling Club was born.\\\\nShe was a solo mum for eleven years before her second marriage to \\\\u2018Sparkie\\\\u2019 in 1989, which these days has blossomed in to 6 grandkids and 5 great grandkids. It wasn\\\\u2019t until 1986 that Gwen realised that there was more to bowls than playing, and she became the multi-titled and multi-tasked Secretary, Treasurer, Delegate and Executive member of the Northland Women\\\\u2019s Bowling Association.\\\\nThat simply opened the floodgates.\\\\nIn 1991, Gwen became The President of the Umpires Association as well as the President of Hikurangi Bowling Club. The following year she became the Hikurangi Centre Delegate \\\\u2013 a position she still holds.\\\\nShe collected another presidency in 1995, becoming President of the Northland Women\\\\u2019s Bowling Association. The same year she volunteered to be the Secretary & Treasurer of the New Zealand Women\\\\u2019s Umpires Association.\\\\nIn 1996, Gwen widened her administrative portfolio, becoming a Registered Coach, assisting the Director of Coaching in the northern area.\\\\nBowls Northland must have thought all their birthdays had come at once having someone to endlessly volunteer like Gwen. \\\\u201cI became a Selector, Coach and Manager of Northland Representative Teams from 2000 until 2016,\\\\u201d recalls Gwen, \\\\u201can Executive Member in 2002 of the amalgamated Bowls Northland and served 15 years on the Board, including three years as President and Chairperson from 2011-2014.

She has also joined the closer-to-home Kamo Bowling Club, where she enjoys just playing as a club member.\\\\nUntil 21 years ago, Gwen was also working a full-time job in Whangarei. And \\\\u2018annual leave\\\\u2019 was about going to the Nationals every year and playing in the tournament with friends. \\\\u201cI went 16 years in a row,\\\\u201d says Gwen, \\\\u201cwe even got through to the last sixteen and quarter-finals a couple of times\\\\u201d.\\\\nThese days, she just likes to go to the North Island Chartered Clubs Tournament \\\\u2013 in November 2018 it was in Tokoroa. \\\\u201cThe four of us have a ball,\\\\u201d laughs Gwen.\\\\nIn May, Gwen and her family will find themselves at Government House in Auckland, where she will be invested with the Queen\\\\u2019s Service Medal. \\\\u201cI am looking forward to it,\\\\u201d says Gwen.

              " '{\"text\": \"Until recently, I had been dating a wonderful girl for 11 months, 3 weeks, and 4 days (at least as far as I can figure).\\\\nHave you ever heard that love is a drug? That\\\\u2019s truer than I knew. It is both frustrating to realize how attached you can become to another person, and yet also liberating to share your life with someone who genuinely wants to take part in it. Not for any reason we can justify or merit we can earn, but just for us. It is simply because we are theirs. Love is blind in its reckless abandon.\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s a great mystery in relationships, isn\\\\u2019t there? I don\\\\u2019t yet understand them. Why is it that we have deep, cavernous holes in our spirits? They are the kind of vacuums that ache for others, for community, in the chance hopes that our isolation will forever be sated. Finally. At rest.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s a scary proposition, to succumb to vulnerability. To surrender your will to another, to tend to their pain over your own, to think of their needs more highly than yours; these are not our nature. But because of that hole in our souls, it is our need, if not our nature. Why else, if the Creator had not wanted it so?\\\\nBut want and desire are not enough. The timing is not always up to us. I\\\\u2019ll never comprehend why those who want companionship the most don\\\\u2019t find it. Still for others, sometimes love fails. Sometimes relationships whither.\\\\nAnd it stings. Like a gnarled skinned knee, and big salty globs of hyperventilation. But oddly\\\\u2026 I don\\\\u2019t regret a second of it. Honestly. I loved, and I lost. And I am alive. And the morning comes, and with it the sun. And if I never walk hand-in-hand again, I will have the memory of having done that once, for 11 months, 3 weeks, and 4 days.\\\\nDeep inside of me, there is an alter ego that wants very much to be alone forever. That self has reasoned that I would be better off to never feel the pain of loss, that loneliness is a smaller price to pay for the lack of effort. It is hard for me to share my burdens in a community of fellow wanderers. Bear with me as I stumble back to my feet. Better yet, give me a hand, will you?\\\\ni don\\\\u2019t really know you, but i\\\\u2019m praying for you too.\\\\nI may or may not have told you this before but I\\\\u2019m really sorry about your recent loss. James and I talked about it on the way to Constantine in the snowstorm after I had read his post about not knowing the right thing to say in these situations. As hard as it is and as much as it hurts to be in any sort of relationships with our fellow human beings it is so much better than the alternative. If God hadn\\\\u2019t created us with that craving for companionship we\\\\u2019d be in a right mess! Think of how it would be if we didn\\\\u2019t have that need for relationships to balance out the baser, more selfish desires. We\\\\u2019d be a mess. I\\\\u2019m glad you\\\\u2019re on the road to healing and talking(writing) about it will definitely help. Hopefully when you come here in March I can at least meet you and say \\\\u2018hi\\\\u2019 since I\\\\u2019ve heard about you for years. I don\\\\u2019t know how to end this\\\\u2026.hang in there seems trite as does \\\\u2018I\\\\u2019m praying for you\\\\u2019, but I am and as such I\\\\u2019ll leave it at that.\\\\nI\\\\u2019m glad you are sharing your heart with us. It will help. We are here for you! Time is a great healer. I wish it were faster than that. You have people who care and will walk with you until the sun shines again.\\\\nRob, I encourage you to read the Psalms. I think they will bring you hope. Read Psalm 34. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.\\\\nRob, I know the voice of that isolated alter ego from my own life, too. Let me assure you that isolation is an addictive drug as well \\\\u2014 I found myself wearing the pain of my lonliness like a shield, using it to keep back the friends who were trying to break through to love and care for me. Consider that the whole history of salvation is of God calling out again and again for a wayward people to return to Him. He, more than anyone else, has certainly known the pain of broken relationships, and is more qualified than any other to meet us in our hurt and carry us through. God Himself will restore your spirit, and He will use the love of friends around you to encourage you along the way.\\\\nTears welled up as I read this. I understand how the deeper inner self wants to \\\\u201cprotect\\\\u201d you from future hurt. But the sun does shine, you will move through this and you have learned much.\\\\nTry having God be the One who always fills your heart. He will never hurt you. Then when your earthly relationships form, dissolve or whatever course they take, you will not feel quite as much heartache and lonliness.\\\\nGod created us first for a relationship with Him, secondly for others. There is a reason for this. We sometimes forget the order, but in His divine wisdom He protects us if only we could just follow Him.\\\\nJust remember Psalm 23 \\\\u2026when we walk \\\\u201cthrough\\\\u201d the valley\\\\u2026 we don\\\\u2019t get stuck there, we go through it.\\\\nYou are special and loved by many.\\\\nI think mom has a picture of you and me in our tree house out in Lone Jack.

I could barely contain my excitement to be eating from my garden so early in the season.\\\\nThis year I took the risk of planting some cold-hardy seeds early in the season. I think it was the weekend of April 16. I planted peas, snow peas, mesclun salad, m\\\\u00e2che, a kale mix and radishes. The weather forecast looked promising: above 10 degrees, but not yet too warm. Perfect for these cool loving plants. Besides, I figured, if they don\\\\u2019t grow now, I\\\\u2019ll just plant again later.\\\\nThen the weather, not surprisingly, changed. It stayed below 10 degrees. It rained, a lot.

It will be interesting to see how the growth of the two rows compares.\\\\nCool weather-loving seeds growing strong.\\\\nMeanwhile I also planted the tomato, pepper, and tomatillo seedlings I\\\\u2019ve been growing indoors since mid-March. This year, to avoid transplanting small seedlings from starter cells to pots, I planted them directly into small pots. Although it was less work, I ended up with some scraggly looking seedlings with long, thin and crooked stems. I think the earth in my pots wasn\\\\u2019t sufficiently packed and I didn\\\\u2019t plant deep enough. Also, the pots were near a window on a tray, which means that they were always leaning toward the light, giving me crooked stems.

I\\\\u2019m also trying companion planting for the first time. The tomatoes are sharing a bed with carrots and spring onions. The beans, planted in a new location that should allow for easier climbing and picking, are matched up with herbs.

I have been home sick today and working on the books while home so not really thinking about inspiring crafty things to write about.\\\\nI am lucky that I have great people working at the shop so I can stay away when sick. A few of them have even worked while sick lately which may be why I am sick and even why some of them got sick. This is a problem we small business owners face and there is not much way around. I wish that it was easier to tell everyone to just stay home if you are sick, but then we would have a hard time opening the shop some days which in turn would lose us sales and in turn would make it hard to stay open. Thank you to all who work so hard and I apologize for not being able to say \\\\u201cjust stay home\\\\u201d! Thank you for letting me stay home!\\\\nIt is December and time to be trying to reconcile everything in the Quickbooks so that we can get our taxes done quickly in the new year. I have to get this done very early every year because I still have a child in college and we need to fill out the FAFSA finacial aid application each year which needs to be done well before the tax deadlines for businesses and personal taxes. This puts pressure on to get things done as early in January as possible. So\\\\u2026I really should be spending more time at home over the next several weeks to get all this book work reconciled and ready for the accountant.\\\\nSo\\\\u2026the blog today is more about the not so exciting but essential things going on behind the scenes of my little quilt shop.\\\\nIf you read this post, thank you!\\\\nI\\\\u2019ll work on more exciting things to come!\\\\nWell, we don\\\\u2019t usually focus solely on batiks but\\\\u2026\\\\u2026we got some pretty, new ones in and out on the floor yesterday so here they are!\\\\nIn order to fit these new batiks, we had to purge some others and being that it is the end of the year and we have to pay a tax on all inventory we still own on 12/31, we decided to purge way more than we needed to. Ready to see that picture?\\\\nYes, this is a lot of fabric that will be going into the sale bin on Saturday! Don\\\\u2019t miss out being first in line on some pretty batiks at below retail prices and seeing the newest batiks at IQ in person this weekend!\\\\nIf your reading this blog, you must have some quilts. Do you keep them folded up and stored somewhere? Do you use them?\\\\n1. To protect the current favorite pet sleep spot on the furniture especially on rainy days when the cat comes in damp. This is a great use of small wall-hanging size quilts. There are regularly small quilts on the couch and rocking chair in Sarah\\\\u2019s house as seen in the picture below.\\\\n2. To protect the car seat when taking the dog in the car.\\\\n3. Draping a folded quilt on the back of a chair the back of a hard-backed chair is a great way to enjoy the beauty of a quilt while also making the chair more comfortable to sit in and keeping a quilt close by for cuddling in the cold.\\\\nWhat are some of your alternate uses for your quilts?\\\\nWe have not been very good about blogging and are working on getting better at it so we are jumping into a 31 day blogging challenge put on by Muppin on the 2nd day of the challenge. We will see how it goes.\\\\nWe have been busy at the shop counting all the fabric we have for our yearly inventory and to update it all in our new POS system. What is a POS system? It is a Point of Sale system (a computerized cash register) that sometimes we all might like to refer to as the pos POS system. While they can keep track of things much better for us, so we can better fill orders online and in the store, they do take a lot of work and bring about a lot of headaches. We are happy to have it though. We just really hope that the company can work out more of the kinks so it runs smoother while we work hard to make sure everything is in the system.\\\\nI will say we have really enjoyed counting all the fabric. We get to put our hands on it, fondle it and see what we have been missing. We have some really pretty fabric! I got to count batiks yesterday and today and man are they pretty. I love this one.\\\\nYou can check out some of our great batiks here.\\\\nCheck back tomorrow for post no. 2.\\\\nEllen Baker of The Long Thread and Sarah Phillips of Intown Quilters are working on an #Instaquilt digital quilt project at the Maker tent at the Decatur Book Festival on Sunday 8/31 at 3pm to join in. Ellen Baker and Sarah Phillips decided to expand on the idea of image sharing to create a collaborative digital project where everyone will create their own quilt block, photograph it, and share the image through social media. Then they\\\\u2019ll compile the images into a digital \\\\u201cquilt\\\\u201d that we\\\\u2019ll share online. Fabric and sewing machines will be available so you can make a block for this fun project. Come on out!\\\\nThe first of our 2014 BOM\\\\u2019s, the Almond Country BOM seen on the right, begins next Tuesday April 1st at 6:30pm.\\\\nHere are some key points about the Block-of-the-month programs at IQ.\\\\n-You do not have to show up at the mettings, as you can pick up your block any time after the meeting each month.\\\\n-The first Tuesday of each month is a BOM sit-and-sew day in the IQ classroom. Bring your machine and your BOM and settle in for some sewing time with your fellow BOM participants!\\\\n-Each BOM program will have a Flickr group where we\\\\u2019ll post photos of that month\\\\u2019s block. You can check out the blocks without being a Flickr member or join the group and post pics of your completed blocks as the year progresses.\\\\n-As always, the cost of each BOM includes all of the fabric for the front of the quilt, the binding, and the pattern or book used with the program.\\\\n-All of our BOM programs are pre-paid in full, so no worries about how your credit card information is kept secure over the course of the year.\\\\n-In most cases, you can join any of our BOM programs at any point in the year. We also offer a shipping option for those who live too far away to take part. Contact us via email or phone for shipping details.\\\\nThis year we have three amazing Block-of-the-Month programs (four quilts) from which you can choose. If you\\\\u2019re new to the whole BOM (that\\\\u2019s the shorthand for Block-of-the-Month) thing, a block-of-the-month program leads participants through a quilt one block per month for a year. You\\\\u2019ll get guidance from an expert instructor (or two!) who\\\\u2019s already made the quilt and end up with a fantastic quilt at the end. All of our BOM programs are pre-paid in full, so no worries about how your credit card information is kept secure over the course of the year.\\\\nWanda Earley will be leading this fabulous paper-pieced BOM starting Tuesday, April 1st. This is a scrappy quilt made with Kaffe Fassett collective fabrics and a pale turquoise batik for the background. You can choose an alternate solid batik background. You will tell us your choice of background and we will have it for you in the the first month\\\\u2019s meeting.\\\\nThe price for the BOM will be $225. This price includes the fabric for the top and binding, the pattern, an hour and a half of teacher time every month, and sit and sew time in the shop.\\\\nBOM meetings will be the 1st Tuesday of each month from 6:30-8pm. You are welcome to come in and sit-n-sew on the first Tuesday after 10am until 8pm.\\\\nOur modern quilting enthusiasts Sarah Oliver and Allyson Shelton return this year with another stellar modern block-of-the-month program. Their Vintage Revival BOM explores one of the hottest new quilting books, Vintage Quilt Revival: 22 Modern Designs from Classic Blocks. Their softer solid palette is a fresh, new take on the modern-meets-vintage trend and will be sure to leave you feeling like springtime all the time!\\\\nThis modern take on classic blocks starts with 6 months of simple piecing and transitions into paper piecing. Come learn new techniques, or brush up on old skills as we sit and sew to create a fun new quilt!\\\\nEach Vintage Revival BOM session includes a two-hour sit-and-sew on the second Saturday of the month from 10 a.m.-noon, during which Allyson and Sarah provide their expertise as they explain, cut, and assemble each block, taking the mystery out of each block. All skill levels will be able to make this quilt.\\\\nThere are two quilt options: a 12-block quilt or a 20-block quilt (shown here). One block per month will be taught leaving you with 12 blocks made in class. If you choose 20 blocks, they will be given as homework each month and you will have Sarah and Allyson\\\\u2019s instructions to take with you. The 20-block BOM quilt is $250 while the 12-block version is $210. This price includes the fabric for the top and binding, the book, two hours of teacher time every month, and sit and sew time in the shop.\\\\nAn Intown Quilters original BOM! We spent weeks trying to find just the perfect block-of-the-month program for 2014. The common thread running through all the quilts we liked? Stars! We fell in love with the Starfall pattern from Fresh Lemon Quilts and contacted designer Faith Jones about using it for this year\\\\u2019s BOM. When she said \\\\u201cyes!,\\\\u201d we immediately dove in to create this year\\\\u2019s Seeing Stars BOM.\\\\nA variety of pieced stars \\\\u2013 10 different styles \\\\u2013 in four different sizes make up this wildly fun and eye-catching block-of-the-month quilt. It\\\\u2019s a modern take on a sampler quilt, with a mix of techniques that will expand your quilting skills. At the end, you\\\\u2019ll have a gorgeous quilt to show off!\\\\nSeeing Stars BOM is led by Sarah Phillips and Mary Abreu and features two colorways. Sarah\\\\u2019s quiltis a scrappy mix of Kaffe prints, shot cotton stripes and blenders on a background of yarn-dyed Essex Linen in Flax. Mary\\\\u2019s Seeing Stars Block of the Month showcases a newsprint background with stars made of a defined palette of zig-zags and polka dots with complementary solids. Her quilt is slightly bigger than Sarah\\\\u2019s with an additional 1.5\\\\u201d frame of the background fabric. There are limited spots for Mary\\\\u2019s background fabric so get your spot for her newsprint background while you can.\\\\nSeeing Stars BOM participants can choose either colorway for their quilt. If you would prefer a solid Kona background for either Seeing Stars quilt, please contact Sarah or Mary.\\\\nThis BOM meets on the second Sunday of the month at 2-4 p.m starting April 13th. We will have a short sewing session with the Seeing Stars BOM. Seeing Stars BOM is $250 for either colorway.\\\\nThis price includes the fabric for the top and binding, the Star Fall pattern, patterns for all the remaining blocks, two hours of teacher time every month, and sit and sew time in the shop.\\\\nSeeing Stars BOM participants are welcome to attend our general BOM sit-and-sew on the 1st Tuesday of the month from 11a-5p. Sarah and/or Mary are usually at the shop on those days until aout 2pm and will be happy to answer questions or offer tips on constructing blocks.\\\\nThis year, we\\\\u2019re adding Flickr groups for each of our BOM programs. We\\\\u2019ll post the latest block additions each month. BOM participants can join the Flickr groups and post their blocks as they progress throughout the year. Because the group is public, you can view the blocks even if you\\\\u2019re not on Flickr.\\\\nThe Greater Atlanta Quilt Shop Hop begins this Saturday!\\\\nYay, this Saturday we begin the week-long shop hop of 2014. We will all be celebrating the 15th anniversary of a shop hop in Atlanta. Don\\\\u2019t miss out. We have far more prizes than we ever have had before.\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"Before Christmas, Supernatural wound up the first half of the season with three solid, if not particularly inspiring, episodes.\\\\nIn \\\\u201cPlush,\\\\u201d the writers tapped into a childhood fear many of us\\\\u2013including Sam\\\\u2013suffer from, turning a play-object, a dress-up mask, into something terrifying. The boys receive a call from Sheriff Donna Hanscum asking for their help with a case. A man in a large and quite disturbing bunny mask has attacked a man and though they\\\\u2019ve apprehended him, they\\\\u2019ve found it impossible to remove the mask. The Sheriff rightly senses that this is something up the hunters\\\\u2019 alley, and the boys, without any idea on how to deal with their current problem of the Darkness, agree to come take a look.\\\\nSheriff Donna\\\\u2019s instincts are good, it turns out because the violence quickly multiplies as other masked individuals are involved in attacks on two men, and Sam and Dean quickly determine that this is a case of ghost possession. Determining the spirit\\\\u2019s geas is a bit more complicated and leads down a very dark path that has the boys scrambling to save the sister and nephew of the ghost from his vengeance: one involving accusations of sexual abuse of children.\\\\nSupernatural is not the first text to make a connection between a disturbing bunny and child molestation. 1985\\\\u2019s Dreamchild gave us an Alice whose memory of her experiences with Lewis Carroll morphed her image of the March Hare into one of the most terrifying spectacles possible in a child\\\\u2019s story. And I wonder if the choice to use a rabbit mask in the first attack might not have been intentionally a link to that film, consciously or unconsciously. Lewis Carroll, like Chester in the episode, was accused (though posthumously in the former case) of inappropriate relations with children, but upon closer examination, most experts have concluded that it is unlikely that the author was guilty of anything sexual with the children with whom he had contact.\\\\nNot that the episode isn\\\\u2019t enjoyable. With Briana Buckmaster back as Sheriff Donna, \\\\u201cPlush\\\\u201d was guaranteed to have great moments and they all involve her. It\\\\u2019s a tough character to play. Too much in one direction and her Minnesota-isms and desire to please become annoying; too much in the other and she loses folksy charm that makes her character work as a contrast (the Prairie Home Hunter). Buckmaster always plays it close to the edge but manages to hold it in check by letting the woman underneath\\\\u2014vulnerable but serious about her work and her choices\\\\u2014shine through at just the right moments. She\\\\u2019s now become a barometer, in seasons that are hit and miss, of an episode worth watching.\\\\n\\\\u201cJust My Imagination\\\\u201d also deals with childhood, ostensibly from a more positive angle, though this is Supernatural, so that doesn\\\\u2019t last long. In this episode, another old friend turns up asking for help with a case, but he\\\\u2019s a very different kind of friend: Sam\\\\u2019s childhood imaginary friend Sully.\\\\nTurns out that imaginary friends are real\\\\u2014they are a race of good beings who guide children (called Zanna)\\\\u2014and someone is bumping them off.\\\\nThe episode gives us a bit of insight into part of the Winchester brothers\\\\u2019 youth that we\\\\u2019ve never seen: a period when Dean was on the road with his dad and Sam was left behind to fend for himself. Alone, not attending school or given anything else to do but prepare himself to be a hunter, Sam was in need not only of companionship but the kind of guidance a Zanna could offer. And for a while, it seemed that Sully was going to be able to divert him into a more normal life.\\\\nFate unfortunately intervened, taking not only Sam down a certain path, but also starting a tragic cascade in Sully\\\\u2019s life culminating in the murder of his closest friends among the Zanna. Sam and a very sarcastic and reluctant Dean investigate the killings to reveal that sometimes, running away from the pain of one event can lead to even more catastrophic ones further down the road\\\\u2014an idea that will lead nicely into the next episode.\\\\nThis episode, though was filled with a variety of good elements. The idea of the Zanna themselves are largely a grab from Drop Dead Fred (1991), but as always, the writers on Supernatural are smart enough to source their content (this time through Dean). And like the out-of-control Fred played by Rik Mayall, the Zanna are friends that only a child could truly appreciate (like Weems, the mulleted, laundress and air-guitarist supreme). Their ability to relate sincerely with the kids and yet still interact with each other as adults who know the seriousness of their work felt right and added to their very human quality, Dean\\\\u2019s protestations notwithstanding.\\\\nWe also got treated to one of the most disturbingly funny scenes ever when Sam, Dean, and Sully investigation the murder scene of Sparkles, the \\\\u201cManicorn.\\\\u201d The inability of adults to see the Zanna initially hid the carnage, but once revealed, it seemed even the deceased\\\\u2019s blood lived up to his name. When the child\\\\u2019s mother entered and began to tidy up, inadvertently coating herself in the glittery gore of the dead Zanna as the squicked and mostly speechless Winchester\\\\u2019s and Sully watched in horror (the latter\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cShe\\\\u2019s got Sparkle on her face\\\\u201d is delivered perfectly by Nate Torrence), the audience squirmed along with them.\\\\nOf course, the moral message of \\\\u201cJust My Imagination,\\\\u201d that Sully could not escape his responsibility for the death of one sister or the emotional well-being of the other, that he could not simply run away, was supposed to be a lead-in to \\\\u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\\\\u201d And while it was well and sensitively delivered in that episode, it largely fell flat in the latter episode which disappointed.\\\\nOne of the problems that we have seen in seasons ten and eleven is a fairly substantial one with pacing. One of the strengths of the show is the ability to keep the myth arc moving at an almost frighteningly fast clip even during freak-of-the-week episodes. During this last season and a half, the myth arc has instead slowed to a frustrating crawl with all of season ten eaten up by a storyline that would have taken earlier seasons three to four episodes to accomplish. This season, we have spent 8 episodes building to the conflict here, framed by Sully\\\\u2019s act of heroism in \\\\u201cJust My Imagination\\\\u201d: Will Sam have the courage to re-enter the cage with Lucifer?\\\\nInstead, what we get is an episode that reworks what we have already seen a dozen of times in the series, and at least once before with pretty much the same players: a devil\\\\u2019s bargain (almost literally and then absolutely literally) to keep one of the boys from actually sacrificing himself to save humanity between the Winchesters, Crowley, Rowena, and eventually, Lucifer. The surprise, that Sam has not been receiving messages from God but from the \\\\u201cMorning Star,\\\\u201d shouldn\\\\u2019t be anything of the kind to anyone who has been watching the series with even half an eye. Nor should Lucifer\\\\u2019s play for freedom nor Sam\\\\u2018s refusal to play along.\\\\nIn fact, the entire exchange is so predictable that it\\\\u2019s hard not to read the body language of Crowley and Rowena, watching from a distance, slumped forward in boredom, as that of the audience.\\\\nThere is, of course, some tension in what will happen next, in that Sam is now trapped in the cage with Lucifer, and Lucifer clearly has plans for him, but I\\\\u2019d bet even money that he\\\\u2019s merely banking on the predictability of Dean risking Heaven, Hell and everything in between to break his brother out of the cage, thinking he can leverage Sam\\\\u2019s jailbreak to get out himself.\\\\nSomewhat more interesting is the still nebulous intentions of Amara. She promises utter bliss for not only Dean but all of humanity while still insisting that everything will be hers and hers alone and that light will be stamped out. Lucifer may be the Prince of Lies, but there\\\\u2019s usually a hint of truth in what he says, and he makes it clear that Amara just isn\\\\u2019t one to deliver like she says she will.\\\\nI am sure these will resolve themselves, but given the series track record of late, I don\\\\u2019t expect it to be anytime soon.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"For Bankies boss Kieran McAnespie the long run-in to the end of the season gives him a chance to have a look at some of the younger players who may be looking to step up from the academy. Coll and McHugh had the chance to impress and Matt McLean started his first match since August.\\\\nThe match started brightly enough with Jordan Shelvey volleying a poor headed clearance narrowly past the post. At the other end Faulds dinked a neat through ball to Degnan, but he made a mess of the chance by firing it wildly over the bar.\\\\nClydebank took the lead in the ninth minute with a strange goal. The ball was hit long, low and hard from back to front. The Cumnock defence could only have mis-read the situation as they allowed the ball to run beyond them. Del Hepburn was onto it in a flash and buried the ball in style.\\\\nThe lead lasted only three minutes as Matt McLean gave away a free kick on the edge of the box. Sean Higgins decided to help his keeper out by standing on the goal line, and when Burns took the kick he seemed perfectly placed when the ball came straight at him. However, he made a complete hash of it getting the ball tangled between his legs and somehow managing to allow it to dribble over the line.\\\\nCumnock were the better team thereafter for the rest of match in terms of general play but the Bankies had far and away the better chances and should have gone into the interval up by at least two more goals.\\\\nShelvey was put through on goal with only the goalkeeper to beat twice, but on both occasions the usually reliable striker seemed to forget his shooting boots. The first effort was saved by Semple as Shelvey delayed too long before shooting. The second time the Bankies front man tried to lob the keeper but was off target. Nicky Little also spurned a great chance just before the break.\\\\nBy the time the second half started, the game had descended mostly into a midfield give away with both teams doing their best to hand the other side possession of the ball. It took ten full minutes before a shot at goal was forthcoming with Burns hitting a weak left footed shot that Morrison dealt with easily.\\\\nThis led to a flurry of Cumnock shots, the best of which saw Burns hit the inside of Morrison\\\\u2019s post. The keeper did well to punch the loose ball away from the inrushing Millar. The Bankies responded with a nice move down the left hand channel which led to Shelvey firing in a dangerous cross. Hepburn should have scored easily but he somehow managed to send the ball over the bar.\\\\nWith quarter of an hour the Bankies regained the lead. Nicky Little nodded the ball down into the box. McKenna looked odds on to clear the ball, but Shelvey managed to nip in front of the defender who then contrived to whip the strikers legs from him. Nicky Little was charged with the responsibility of taking the spot kick. He sent the ball to the keeper\\\\u2019s right, but the power was too much for Semple who guessed correctly but couldn\\\\u2019t quite keep the ball out. Little\\\\u2019s 23rd goal of the season took his career tally to 65, and one more will make him the top goalscorer in the current era.\\\\nClydebank didn\\\\u2019t really deserve the lead so they decided only to keep it for four minutes. In a carbon copy of the first half a free kick was given away just outside the box. Burns took it again. This time Burns was denied by a stunning one handed save by Morrison as he tipped the ball against the bar. A Cumnock player followed up only to hit the underside of the bar, but it was unlucky for Andy Paterson who had returned to the goal-line as the ball dropped against him and crossed the line.\\\\nThe Bankies display was quite disjointed, maybe understandable after a month of no competitive games. Although there is nothing to play for, the last games of the season will be useful for looking at the team and assessing where improvements can be made for next season. The next match is against Renfrew who are a bit of a bogey team for Clydebank. The Bankies have lost their last three matches against the Western Park men and will be looking to reverse this sequence.\"}\\n',\n",

Last night\\'s game was not unlike any of the other overtime losses the team has suffered in the last decade, but it was enough to finally make me ask, Just how bad are the Red Wings in playoff overtime games? So I decided to do a little digging and see whether or not my beliefs (that the Wings simply cannot get it done in overtime) actually align with reality.\\\\nNHL.com has the result of every game dating back to the 2003-2004 season*. I was hoping to look at games beginning in 2000, but only to make numbers round and aesthetically pleasing. The following are individual teams\\' overtime record by year, followed by their composite record over the time span.\\\\nSo... yes, the Red Wings are very bad in overtime playoff games. The team is 6-11 over the time period, which is a .353 winning percentage. During the regular season over that time period, the Wings are winning at a .613 clip.\\\\nThe Sharks have played in more playoff overtime games (22) than any other team. The next closest is the Wings with 17. Unfortunately, the Sharks are 12-10 and the Wings record is... what it is. Then again, heading into this postseason, the Sharks were 7-10 in such playoff OT games.\\\\nWith the exception of Nashville (2-4) the Wings have the worst playoff overtime winning percentage of any team that has played in more than 5 playoff OT games. The gut wrenching feeling you get every time the Wings go to OT is a valid one.\\\\nBoston has the best playoff OT record of any team that has played more than 5 games, clocking in at a scorching 10-3.\\\\nAs you can tell (and as you might expect), most teams hover around the .500 area.\\\\nThe question is whether or not specific play styles lead toward a better or worse OT record, but that\\'s something I don\\'t have the time or resources to investigate. In any case, you can feel safe saying that the Wings are an awful playoff overtime team, especially when you take into account their record, seeding, and likely the lesser competition they\\'re playing in those games.\\\\n*The 2004-2005 season never happened because of the NHL lockout.\"}\\n',\n",

It\\\\u2019s fleeting and you find yourself floating back down, like a balloon slowly farting out its air.\\\\nAnyway, I thought it was about time I posted some FAQ\\\\u2019s, in case you\\\\u2019re still not sure whether yin yoga is for you. Believe me, it\\\\u2019s for everyone.\\\\nYin yoga is a restorative form of yoga that utilizes props (blocks, bolsters, straps, blankets) to enable you to hold postures for a longer period of time, allowing for deeper opening in the body and targeting the fascia, connective tissues and joints.\\\\nIt has meditative quality as you give up resistance in your body and mind simultaneously, and can be quite healing over time.\\\\nI like to describe fascia and other connective tissues as being like bubble wrap that wraps around your body, protecting and enveloping organs, muscles and bones. You could also think of it as webbing in your body.\\\\nFascia is very fluid \\\\u2013 there are fibrous tissues that are elastic and they are hydrated by facial fluid \\\\u2013 you may have heard of synovial fluid that lubricates the hip joints. When fascia dries out we feel stiff and stuck and may lose joint mobility and support. Think of all the bubbles in the wrap being popped so that it loses its protective quality. only with fascia the bubbles are filled with fluid.\\\\nWhy is it called yin yoga?\\\\nTraditional yoga actually incorporates 8 limbs that include moral and ethical codes and practices, breathing practices (pranayama), and meditation practices as well as what many people popularly think of as yoga \\\\u2013 asana practice.\\\\nMost asana practice, like most exercise, is yang-based, or at least skewed towards yang postures. So whether the tradition is Hatha, Iyengar, Bikram (hot) or Ashtanga, the focus is on dynamic movement of the muscles to enhance overall strength and flexibility. Generally certain postures, particularly on the floor, will call for a more yin approach.\\\\nYin yoga flips the dynamic focus, switching off the muscles, which relax with time, in order to go deeper, with fewer, long-held and supported postures.\\\\nCan you explain a bit more about the difference between yin and yang?\\\\nThe misconception a lot of people have is that yin and yang are opposites \\\\u2013 they think in black and white terms. Yin and yang compliment each other and are relative to each other. So we know what fast feels like because we\\\\u2019ve experienced slow, what hot is because we\\\\u2019ve been cold. Our experiences will all differ so it\\\\u2019s subjective.\\\\nNight compliments day \\\\u2013 neither yin or yang are good or bad. However regular readers will know how convinced I am that we need more yin in our fast, busy and competitive world \\\\u2013 we need a reYINvention.\\\\nSo in terms of yin yoga, it is slower and deeper, relative to yin yoga and in a way that compliments more dynamic practice.\\\\nFirst of all, flexibility is relative, so don\\\\u2019t talk yourself out of yoga in general or yin yoga in particular.\\\\nYin yoga is actually good even with limited flexibility because you can always use props to support you \\\\u2013 for example if your spine is very rounded you can add an extra bolster or place a block on top in a seated forward fold position in order to get just a little deeper.\\\\nIt takes time and that\\\\u2019s OK. Remember its yoga practice not yoga perfect.\\\\nI have a monkey mind, I couldn\\\\u2019t stay still for so long?\\\\nThen you need yin yoga!\\\\nYin yoga is good for those who can\\\\u2019t still their mind to meditate (we never actually stop thinking we just learn to let thoughts float through). With the focus on the physical opening in your body, you can focus your monkey mind on your gripping hip or tight shoulder and take your breath to that point to help in the releasing process. You might release a negative thought pattern at the same time.\\\\nUnlike sitting still in meditation, the postures give you something to focus on, so yin yoga is great preparation for deepening into meditation.\\\\nIt still sounds slow, how can you tell you are getting \\\\u2018results\\\\u2019?\\\\nI\\\\u2019m not going to lie, during a yin yoga class you may feel stiffer (I tell students you may feel 100 years old). But that\\\\u2019s the release of the stuck fascia, trapped energy, negative emotions, which you feel in the space between postures.\\\\nEnergy becomes unstuck and starts to flow (and believe me your whole body wants to flow). Some postures target to open specific chakras or meridian energy lines.\\\\nOver time you\\\\u2019ll find yourself more flexible during both exercise and regular activity \\\\u2013 you may feel lighter, both physically and mentally, as you give up long-held resistance.\\\\nI\\\\u2019m pretty convinced you\\\\u2019ll feel good. I\\\\u2019ve had students come out of class saying they\\\\u2019re \\\\u2018drunk on yoga\\\\u2019 if that\\\\u2019s any clue!\\\\nI\\\\u2019m working on core strength at the moment but any tips for relieving the pain of an unstable pelvis and dodgy Si joint?\\\\nThanks Grace \\\\u2013 I feel like a real yin yoga teacher now.\"}\\n',\n",

And I felt so mad, because I had done everything right. I had done everything Ina May\\'s Guide to Childbirth said to do. Why had it ended up being such a thing of terror instead a thing of joy? Why had it left me feeling so defeated instead of elated? I was angry at the hippies in the book for describing contractions as \\\\\"waves\\\\\" or \\\\\"rushes.\\\\\" Those words just didn\\'t do it justice. It was more like a tsunami or being run over by a train but somehow managing to stay alive only to feel the impact over and over again.

I never want to go back to that horrible, horrible dark, place of never not feeling like I was going to vomit, of never having any relief from the nausea, not even for a moment. And I never want to have a newborn again. Not one that cries and cries and cries all the time. Nobody understands how much he cried (and still cries), not even Rob. I was the one who was home alone with him, all day, every day. I don\\'t know what was wrong with him. I guess I never will.\\\\nBut the thing is, I think I could give birth again. I want a do-over. Even though going through the experience was completely awful and terrifying at the time, I can look back on it now and think of it as truly amazing. I still kind of can\\'t believe that I did it. Nothing in life will ever, ever compare. Everything else is just so pale. Instead of remembering the terrible, defeating moments when I was sure they were going to cut me open before I could muster, \\\\\"I do not consent,\\\\\" I remember the hugely immense power of the contractions. Power like a volcano erupting or like an earthquake ripping the earth in two. I remember how some sort of primal instinct took over, how I intuitively felt the need to stay vertical and how I knew how to hum, moan, breathe through the contractions. I remember how I let go, just completely surrendered to it. Each contraction felt like being thrown from a cliff, hitting the water some thousand miles below and feeling it break every bone in your body.

Despite corresponding in-vitro gene expression studies being a focus of interest for many years, no information is available for hPDL fibroblasts on suitable reference genes, which are generally used in RT-qPCR experiments to normalize variability between samples. The aim of this study was to identify and validate suitable reference genes for normalization in untreated hPDL fibroblasts as well as experiments on orthodontic tooth movement or periodontitis (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). We investigated the suitability of 13 candidate reference genes using four different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, comparative Delta C-q and BestKeeper) and ranked them according to their expression stability. Overall PPIB (peptidylprolyl isomerase A), TBP (TATA-box-binding protein) and RPL22 (ribosomal protein 22) were found to be most stably expressed with two genes in conjunction sufficient for reliable normalization.

I tell myself that flesh will regrow and the spirit replenish.\\\\nEvery morning on my toilet seat, I think the same thoughts. I brush my teeth and I shower using the same brand of toothpaste and soap. And it will be exactly 7:46 in the clock above the mirror, when I come out of the bathroom. The CD player will be on the same note of Kevin Kern. The morning tea and the toasts taste exactly the same. I exchange the same courtesies with the old lady who has stopped aging since the four years I have been seeing her in the lift. She wears the same clothes and carries the same smell of medicated oil. In the office, I attend the same meetings, look at the same plans, make the same comments, write the same emails to the same people. I eat the same home-cooked lunch my wife packs for me, while my colleagues praise her for being so loving. I nod in acknowledgement.\\\\nI am not a rich man, yet my life, so carefully mapped out by my prudent wife, has allowed me a few luxuries without the bite of debt. My recent acquisition was a car. Yesterday the passenger door hit a post as it was being opened. It left a minute but noticeable dent. It created a bigger wound to my mind, which kept brooding about it the rest of the day. Then, later in the night as I lay staring at the ghostly shimmers of a shuttering-down city, I realised that I was no longer upset about the dent. But the more I thought about it, a feeling of disappointment began to grow in me like an unpleasant after-taste. Until then I never thought of myself as a materialist. I have never worked hard for a pay raise; nothing in the endless shop-windows of city have caught my fancy. Except for a strange fetish for DIY hardware (toolsets, electric drills etc) and computer accessories, I have had no major urge to splurge on toys. Yes, sleek notebooks and palmtops have seductively called at me from newspaper advertisements like Russian prostitutes in the shadows of a traffic light on my way home. With hardly an effort, I have resisted their calls. And here I am brooding over a scratch.\\\\nThis small incident was like a blip in the featureless radar of my life. A kink in this eternal present that reminded me that there was still hope. For some reason I concluded that the city was to blame. The heady musk of money that pervaded the city in every sickening cranny sunk into the very marrow of its denizens trapping them in a recycled time, a repeating history. They do not realise the immortality of their misery; a misery itself cloaked in the garb of comfort, of convenience. They do not realise that on death they will return to relive this illusion of contentment. By stealth, the city becomes a deathless addiction. I realise that even the endlessly repeating days and nights are its respirations\\\\u2014inhaling light, exhaling darkness. And in its bowels, we, little minions, tirelessly work for its preservation and expansion.\\\\nThis was my revelation. This will be my rebirth.\\\\nBut routine and guilt are twin sisters, and I instantly thought about family and responsibility. Like some programming that was hardwired in my brain. In my mind a weighing balance seesawed\\\\u2014one pan held my family and in the other was my form afire. And my deathless ghost loomed large. That was it.\\\\nWith the single-mindedness of a torpedo, I shot down my guilt and logged in. And I hummed the \\\\u201cfreedom\\\\u201d mantra to deafen the cries of my pesky conscience. The lonely hearts internet forums like friendfinder, craigslist, match.com all carried my profile. Among a million others. The world was such a lonely and miserable place.\\\\nTo make a living, I plan.\\\\nAnd do have a sparkling wit.\\\\nAs you note, I was honest about my familial situation, at least that much of my conscience was undisturbed. But as the poem unfolded, I wondered whether it was a relationship or an experience that I truly sought. But it was no time for such spirals of introspection. Perhaps an experience comes out of a relationship, I consoled myself. To further add credibility to my profile, I attached a clear photograph of myself in decent clothes and in a casual setting. It was not my best photograph, but it was the most recent and I looked sincere and moderately attractive though a trifle geeky with my intellectual eyes sparkling behind rimless spectacles. I thought I detected a dreaminess in them that I instantly liked.\\\\nTaking one last look at my profile before I clicked the submit button, I was hoping that it would attract someone as lost as myself in these dark labyrinthine veins of the city.\\\\nI was not concerned that someone I know would come across my profile; as a matter fact that only added to the experience. To this quiet rebellion against the city.\\\\nYou clearly have its infirmity.\\\\nAnd there perhaps a friendship strikes.\\\\nHer profile indicated she was young (twenty one) and extremely attractive. There was a photograph of her sitting daintily in a sofa, in what looked like an expensive restaurant. Slim and fine boned, she was a picture of elegance and poise, with her hands gracefully crossed on her laps and a light smile on her lips. To me she resembled an anachronistic Audrey Hepburn in her fine china delicateness. But today, in the world of Flickr and Photoshop, your eyes are the least you can trust.\\\\nThe date held no meaning to me. But in this age of Google, information was the least of your problems.\\\\nSo it was a quote from a movie called \\\\u201cV for Vendetta\\\\u201d. The pages of IMDB told me that the movie was about anarchy and violent rebellion. Maybe the date held some special meaning for her. Was it her birthday, or an anniversary of some sort? I noted from my calendar the 5th of November was just two days away.\\\\nI decided to respond to her\\\\u2014what have I got to lose?\\\\u2014and invited her to a chat line.\\\\nur profile was 2 cryptic. hardly anythin there\\\\u2026 so my imagination went haywire\\\\u2014I lied about my imagination. I thought it was a good way to start the conversation.\\\\nwhat did you imagine? \\\\u2014was her reply.\\\\nnothin\\\\u2026 I thot maybe ur some anarchist babe out to stir trouble in the city\\\\u2014u kno with dat quote from dat movie\\\\u2026 \\\\u2014it was meant to be a joke.\\\\ndo you like the city? \\\\u2014she asked.\\\\nwhich is a box in the sky. a single cell of the beast.\\\\nwhat beast? \\\\u2014I asked. I was uneasy and did not like how this conversation was turning out. Maybe this was not such a good idea after all.\\\\ndon\\\\u2019t act daft. you know what I am talking about.\\\\nI thought you would agree\\\\u2026 I almost sensed it when I read your profile.\\\\nwell, there\\\\u2019s nothing we can do about it, is there?\\\\nthat\\\\u2019s where I don\\\\u2019t agree with you.\\\\nsimple things\\\\u2026 for example, if we tell you to deliver a few packages to some places in the city on a certain date and if we convince you that that would help in killing the beast, would you do it?\\\\nCold sweat broke on my temples. Who is this I am chatting with? My fingers trembled over the keyboard.\\\\nAre you there, man of rhyme?\\\\nThat night I couldn\\\\u2019t sleep. Was she for real? I tried to convince myself that I am making too much out of this chat. Maybe it was just a bunch of kids trying to scare me. The following day I clicked on the link to her profile that was in my email. The webpage told me that it had been deleted. A trial email that I sent to her also bounced, telling me that no such account existed. Maybe it was all just a prank after all.\\\\nOn the sixth of November the newspapers had the biggest headlines I had seen in a long time.\"}\\n',\n",

The girls both sailed and partied hard!\\\\nIn the first day of racing, Monday, 3 races were held in a nice F3 out in the bay. Phil and Laura Bevan won the first race, followed by Dave and Beth Porter (note the \\\\u201cfather / daughter\\\\u201d theme). Race 2 and 3 were won by Jeremy and Rebecca Stephens (another \\\\u201cfather / daughter\\\\u201d team).\\\\nThe second day brought more wind, F4. This proved to the liking of Paul Hobson and Craig Wheatley who banged in two bullets in races 4 and 5. There was a slight drama during race 5 when Paul and Craig got to the windward mark only to realise they had no idea where the wing mark was. The fleet blindly followed them towards the shore, until eventually the mark was spotted way downwind. The fleet then peeled off to go virtually side by side down what was now a run. Martin and Abigail came second in race 4 and Jeremy and Rebecca second in race 5.\\\\nRacing resumed on the Thursday after the lay-day. Race 6 was held in light winds F2/3 with the windward mark under the cliffs towards Pwllheli. This resulted in some big holes and interesting wind shifts. There were some big place changes; one of the more dramatic being when Phil and Laura whilst near the front of the fleet took an extreme left route on the second beat leaving the rest of the fleet to head out to sea \\\\u2013 only to lose at least 10 places. At the end, it was the reigning National Champion, Tim Sadler sailing with Millie Pryke that mastered the conditions to get the win.\\\\nFor the second race of the day (race 7), the course was re-set towards the west in better wind. A slight pin bias and a favoured left side saw the leading group of boats emerge from there. Phil and Jane, Phil and Laura, and Tim and Millie, rounded the windward mark in that order. These three pulled out ahead and after a close battle, it was Tim and Millie who got their second win of the day, followed by Phil and Jane, then Phil and Laura.\\\\nThe forecast for Friday had always been rather scary looking. So, when the fleet gathered on the beach with the wind howling, there was more than a degree of trepidation.

Getting down to the start was exhilarating enough, but then the wind and waves increased!\\\\nThe beat was hard work with mains frequently flogging. Down the first run Jeremy and Rebecca showed outstanding (foolhardy, idiotic) downwind speed to fly past Phil and Laura to lead through the gate. It was the same story on the second lap.Yet again Jeremy and Rebecca went for broke and let it rip downwind. They sneaked into the lead just before the finish, but having sailed hotter angles needed to do two extra gybes to get through the gate. This allowed Phil and Laura to get on the inside and claim their second race win.\\\\nWith the points all added up it was a clear and well deserved overall win for Jeremy and Becca Stephens. They finished in the top 10 in all races with a discard of 7th. This is their first National Championship victory and are a popular and well-liked team.

Since June, I have been in the \\\\u201cMartha\\\\u201d role of welcoming many to my home to pray with \\\\u201cMother Mary\\\\u201d who always leads us to the feet of her son. Now, I was hearing \\\\u201cthe clarion call to silence\\\\u201d and this gospel was just a powerful confirmation of that call I had received!\\\\nSo I left on Tuesday afternoon, heading to the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception on the North Shore of Long Island. I was leaving the crowd and looking to spend time with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament and to listen and dwell with Truthfulness. Driving out peacefully through the side roads of rolling countryside, I knew that Jesus had many surprises in store for me. . . if I just cooperated in making that transition of leaving all the worrying and fretting at home! I promised to do that and He made good on his promises as well. The surprises came one after the other and I understood \\\\u201cTruth\\\\u201d like I\\\\u2019ve never understood it before.\\\\nIt took me some time to make that disconnect with the worries and fretting. The first thing I did after letting my sons know I had arrived, was to turn the phone off. No texting, no emails, no looking up things on the internet. When I put the phone aside such a freedom was born in that moment! I was free, too, from \\\\u201cMartha\\\\u2019s work\\\\u201d of cooking, shopping, cleaning and chores. My freedom allowed me to do nothing but be present to Jesus, to receive Him in the Eucharist, adore and listen to His holy word in scripture.\\\\nWhen one goes on retreat, you really never know what to expect or who may even be sitting in prayer beside you. On these Eucharistic retreats, you know that there will be priests praying along with you in adoration which is so beautiful to experience. It makes the words the Body of Christ so much more a reality to see this manifested before your very eyes.\\\\nThe first couple of days it was just myself and another soul praying before the Monstrance. We knew we were gifted to be in that silence together and to be united in prayer. There was a great intimacy in knowing that our hearts were in adoration together. We sat side by side like bookends and I know my prayer was made stronger through her presence. Days later, we were joined by others. When the retreat ended and we came out of silence on Sunday, one of the other retreatants shared with me that she flew in from Houston to share in this special silent time! It was another gift to have had the opportunity to be beside her as well.\\\\nI knew, too, that the words that Msgr. Michael had sent me off on retreat with were \\\\u201cgolden words of wisdom.\\\\u201d These words were not only for myself but for all those who want to hear truth and dwell with Him. The retreat director gave me a series of scripture readings to sit with. The reading below seemed to jump out at me in light of all that was happening back at home with Mama Mary\\\\u2019s visitation in the last couple of months.\\\\nThere wasn\\\\u2019t a time at the retreat that you did not hear the rustle of rosary beads before the Monstrance. They were in the hands of my fellow retreatants but also in the hands of the priests that silently adored in union with us. \\\\u201cWhat power pours forth from those beads,\\\\u201d I thought to myself as I prayed silently along, reflecting on each meditation in the life of Jesus and Mary.\\\\nEvery evening we prayed Night Prayer from the Liturgy of the Hours together before Jesus was reposed. The Divine Office is another way of being fed each new day in union with the whole Church. The readings are so very rich from the Church Fathers. It was most certainly a community prayer that wove us altogether with the Universal Church.\\\\nThe days and nights passed so quickly and I literally savored every moment. I continuously wrote in my journal lest I forget what I was experiencing. My last day of retreat ended on Sunday with a designated Preached Day of Prayer, which was so life-giving. Jesus, we were told by one of the priests, \\\\u201ccame to earth to have union with us and so we are called to \\\\u201ccling to Him!\\\\u201d I believe that was what Mother Mary was conveying to me as well.\\\\n\\\\u201cGlorify the Lord with me Together Let us Praise His name.\\\\nI sought the Lord and He answered me, from all my terrors He set me free.\\\\nBefore I knew it, I was packing up my car with my bags. Then I was driving home once again through the beautiful roads leaving the Seminary listening to the song Redeemer, which I share with you below. I pray as you listen to the violins, cello and piano, that you hear the voice of the One who always calls us to sit at His feet.\\\\nGleaning the Graces after a retreat is a process that one experiences on a day-to-day basis, sometimes even years after.Jesus always surprises in subtle whispers but also in blasts of the Holy Spirit to wow us!!!!\\\\nThis sunrise image was yet one more surprise that Jesus blessed with me on retreat which I share with you as well!\\\\nCling to Him and Have Union with Him!\\\\nMay you, too, hear the clarion call to sit in His silence and be at His Feet!\"}\\n',\n",

One of the ways in which jurisdictions are meeting this challenge is through inclusionary zoning, a program that principally requires developers to include affordable homes when they build a particular number of market-rate homes. This paper examines the effectiveness of inclusionary zoning programs as tools for not only providing affordable housing, but also ensuring that such housing is built throughout a jurisdiction. Focusing particularly on the Montgomery County, MD ordinance and those found in three other Greater Washington area jurisdictions, this paper will: highlight the effectiveness of inclusionary zoning in several jurisdictions; examine the obstacles facing new and old ordinances alike; and identify where opportunities for change exist to ensure the program\\\\u2019s longevity and productivity.

Walls of windows send in plenty of natural light and the ocean breeze. It\\'s minutes from Yale, seconds from the best boutique Italian grocers New Haven has to offer, and it\\'s a very family friendly and safe area.\\\\nMy husband and I recently moved here from Northampton, MA, and I was just offered a postdoc at Penn, so we have to be off by the end of July. In the time we have spent here we have fallen in love with the whole place---walking along the village paths, running in the numerous parks, and enjoying imported cheeses and fresh Italian pastries from Romeo\\'s and the Orange Street Market (next door!). It\\'s magical and we are sad to leave, but excited for new adventures. Our loss is your gain--truly!\\\\nThe apartment has a large open kitchen, a central room which we use for dining and seating, and a very large bedroom (we have a full size couch, and a King sized bed, and could probably still fit another couch in there, tbh). There is ample storage space in the numerous closets, as well as adorable reading nooks throughout the house.\\\\nThe bathroom in the main part of the apartment is a bit small and cozy, but (by some strange magic) includes a large, extra-long bathtub which you can relax in while gazing into the wonderful sunlight that streams in through a romantic recessed skylight.\\\\nAcross the foyer, and out the door to the living room, is the staircase down and the second bedroom across it. It has its own separate keyed entry. This is a large furnished suite with a wall of windows. Perfect for a mother-in-law, a spacious study, or art studio.\\\\nThere is a small yard with plenty of space to setup a little garden entertaining area. Plenty of off-street parking, and a large shared patio with rocking chairs. The basement is a labyrinth of space for those needing storage or musical practice. The washer and dryer are free to use for tenants.\\\\nWhy is it so affordable?! Well, the owners very occasionally (once every two-three months?) will politely arrange a time to come in through the separate second bedroom to the hidden room that sits behind it, where they have stored books and a few odds and ends. They will only come in with your permission and prior approval. They are an older artsy couple, live in the apartment on Floor 1 & 2 and share floor 1 with one other tenant. You have access to both the hidden room and the large closet in the hidden room whenever you like, to store items (or as I wanted too, to set up a desk for writing).\\\\nI am an anthropologist who works in Haiti and Ghana!

              " '{\"text\": \"Central Missouri is a gorgeous area surrounded by hiking paths, caves, and tall limestone rock formations making it a perfect area for residents who enjoy the occasional, or more frequent, outdoor activity. Located in Columbia, there is Rock Bridge Park, which is home to Devil\\\\u2019s Ice Box. Many times, you may find a group of college students excited to explore every crevice of the cave even if that means getting completely soaked in the process. If you prefer not to wade through the cold water, you can still hike along the paths of the park and enjoy the surrounding nature. Not far from Rock Bridge Park is Capen Rock Park. Capen Rock Park is more geared towards those who want to climb up a simple rock formation and look over an edge, but it\\\\u2019s not the best option for a thrill seeker. For those wanting to really tap into their adrenaline, we recommend The Pinnacles near Sturgeon. Now, it\\\\u2019s not going to be adrenaline-filled like skydiving might be, but these rocks require more athletic ability to ensure you don\\\\u2019t fall.\\\\nYou may be thinking right now, \\\\\"Don\\\\u2019t say Jefferson City. I live here. I know everything there is to do.\\\\\" Too bad. Tour Jefferson City for a day, and not in the way that you might go about touring it every day. Spend your day as if you are a tourist and try to see the city through a new set of eyes. Start the day with your favorite espresso drink from Three Story Coffee just down the street from the Capitol. Tour the Capitol building, the museum, and its surrounding memorials. Walk through the Governor\\\\u2019s garden and pose with the Lewis and Clark statues. Pop into the small boutiques as you walk downtown and grab a cone of ice cream from Central Dairy. You may remember why you love Jefferson City again. And then, if you get a chance, grab a show at the Miller Performing Arts Center put on by Jefferson City Public Schools. But if you REALLY want to get away: Try St. Louis for a day of fun at the City Museum and free zoo.\\\\nThere are many towns with a ton of charm in the surrounding area. But one that is perfect for a day away, and was actually named \\\\\"One of America\\\\u2019s 10 Coolest Small Towns,\\\\\" is Rocheport. Rocheport is just a short drive from Columbia and is a wine-lover\\\\u2019s paradise. With Les Bourgeois setting up their winery in the area and adding to the Missouri River Wine Tour, Rocheport has become a must stop location for Missouri travelers. It also boasts beautiful bridges with fantastic nature views and small-town festivals that anyone can enjoy. Start your day exploring the small city and enjoying the scenic routes it has to offer and end your day enjoying a nice dinner and glass of wine at the Blufftop Bistro.\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s a day trip that would make anyone jealous of your travels in Central Missouri. Just don\\\\u2019t forget to be gumby (feel free to mix the plan up and roll with the flow) because that\\\\u2019s when you get the best out of your trip.\"}\\n',\n",

To Devante Owens, this studio has become a familiar home over the past several months as he prepares for his upcoming B.F.A. exhibition on Oct. 2 and reflects on his collection, what inspires him, and how his passion for making art came to be.\\\\n\\\\u201cYou feel intimidated by making something that\\\\u2019s not perfect, but it doesn\\\\u2019t have to be,\\\\u201d Owens said.\\\\nOwns shared how he took an art class over the summer at UAF where he rediscovered his passion for making art. He immediately switched his major and has been doing it since then. He spends most of his time in the art department these days.\\\\nNow dominated by giant images of space and ocean creatures, his work space is filling up with images for his upcoming exhibitions. Angler fish creep out from behind planets and a sailboat tears through a star filled seascape in some of his recent work.\\\\nAlthough he is now at home in the studio, he did not start there.

For this project, he has taken on larger scale printmaking work.\\\\n\\\\u201cAs a whole, I want the gallery to explain a little bit of the processes behind printmaking,\\\\u201d said Owens, regarding the larger theme for his exhibition collection.\\\\nHis interest in art goes back to childhood and he says his ambition to create only increased as grew older.\\\\nOne of his self admitted struggles has been time management. Several of his paintings are large in scale, taking a great deal of time to complete.\\\\nOwens also discussed some of his opinions on audiences and their connection to art. He believes people can feel disconnected, especially if they are not artists themselves. However, he maintains that art is a process that takes a great deal of work and does not simply appear on the canvas the way it is shown.\\\\nWith his B.F.A. being his primary focus, Owens says has taken time off of work to dedicate his time and energy to his art.

Net income for the full year 2014 was $505 million, or $4.38 per diluted share, largely attributable to the previously announced pretax gain of $726 million on the sale of approximately $8 billion of real estate assets1,2.\\\\nFor Core Consumer Operations, core earnings (a non-GAAP measure) for the quarter was $65 million, versus $48 million in the prior year quarter, and earnings per diluted share (a non-GAAP measure) was $0.57 for the fourth quarter versus $0.43 in the prior year quarter3,4.

The historical accounting basis (which is a basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP) also provides better comparability of the operating results of these segments to our competitors and other companies in the financial services industry. The historical accounting basis is not applicable to Acquisitions and Servicing since this segment resulted from the purchase of the SpringCastle Portfolio on April 1, 2013 and therefore, was not affected by the Fortress Acquisition.\\\\nPretax Core Earnings is a key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of our Core Consumer Operations. Pretax Core Earnings represents our income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes on a historical accounting basis and excludes results of operations from our Non-Core Portfolio (legacy real estate loans) and other non-originating legacy operations, gains (losses) resulting from accelerated long-term debt repayment and repurchases of long-term debt related to Core Consumer Operations (attributable to Springleaf), gains (losses) on fair value adjustments on debt related to Core Consumer Operations (attributable to Springleaf), one-time costs associated with debt refinance related to Consumer and Insurance, and results of operations attributable to non-controlling interests. Pretax Core Earnings provides us with a key measure of our Core Consumer Operations\\\\u2019 performance as it assists us in comparing its performance on a consistent basis. Management believes Pretax Core Earnings is useful in assessing the profitability of our core business and uses Pretax Core Earnings in evaluating our operating performance. Pretax Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, net income, operating cash flow, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\\\\nSpringleaf management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results and other general matters at 10:00 am Eastern on Thursday, March 12, 2015.

You\\'re not alone: In 2015 the CRA noted that by the last week of April, about half of Canadians had not yet filed their taxes. But from penalties to missed benefits, there are plenty of reasons to conquer your procrastinating ways. And if you\\'re expecting a refund, it can quite literally pay to be ahead of the curve.\\\\nThe good news is, you don\\'t have to face tax time alone. In partnership with H&R Block, here are five tips to keep you on top of your tax game in 2019.\\\\nCircle April 30, 2019 on your calendar\\\\u2009\\\\u2014\\\\u2009it\\'s the absolute last day you\\'ll want to file your return. You can file in person, online or even by mail. If you owe taxes, missing this deadline could incur some serious penalties, meaning you\\'ll owe the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) even more money. Starting May 1, the penalty for procrastinating comes in at 5 per cent of your outstanding balance, and then an additional 1 per cent for every month you\\'re late thereafter, up to 12 months. And that\\'s not including interest! In order to save yourself money, it\\'s best to pay on time.\\\\nLet\\'s be real: Trying to root through a year\\'s worth of financial info in one fell swoop would be madness; getting into the routine of updating your records regularly just makes sense. Breaking your workload into smaller chunks is a great way to overcome procrastination.\\\\nFor instance, if you run a small business, consider carving out time at the end of each week to go over receipts and expenditures you could reasonably write-off. It\\'s a good idea to scan or photocopy everything in case there\\'s a chance you\\'ll lose a receipt.\\\\nIf you\\'re expecting a refund, you want to get that cash back as soon as possible, right? Though filing your tax return late might not incur any penalties, the government isn\\'t going to rush your return to the front of the line either. Any monthly or quarterly tax credit payments on benefits you may be entitled to, such as GST/HST credits or the Canada Child Benefit could be interrupted if your return isn\\'t filed on time. Pushing off the paperwork until after April 30 is just penalizing your pocketbook.\\\\nWhile no one wants to make a costly mistake on their tax return, a little human error isn\\'t the end of the world, and can actually be fixed. Once you\\'ve received your initial assessment, you\\'ll need to put all the extra information into a T1-ADJ form and wait for an updated assessment. If you\\'re confused or overwhelmed about the error, don\\'t feel you have to tackle it alone: H&R Block Tax Experts are truly that \\\\u2013 experts. If there are any issues with a return you filed, you can visit an office and get the help you need instead of managing multiple forms.\\\\nAs online tax software becomes increasingly more sophisticated, many people take a DIY approach to filing their returns. But not all of us are tax aficionados, so having a second set of eyes on your paperwork can fill in the gaps. Speaking with a professional is a simple and convenient way to make sure you\\'re maximizing your claim. Expert Review is a service from H&R Block where a tax expert reviews your return to answer any questions and make suggestions to further improve your refund or decrease what you owe.\\\\nWith more than 50 years of experience, the team at H&R Block is ready to help answer your toughest income tax questions at any of their 1,100 locations nationwide.\"}\\n',\n",

We showed that these explanations do not correspond to historical truth and do not give an adequate explanation of the destiny of the Russian revolution after 1917\\\\u2014not to speak of the destiny of world revolution.\\\\nIn his reply, Krass\\\\u00f3 tries to defend his hypothesis both by general theoretical arguments and by an attempt to refute some of the factual material which I introduced into the discussion.footnote1 Both attempts fail. They illustrate more clearly than Krass\\\\u00f3\\\\u2019s initial piece the basic weakness of his analysis, which consists in departing from the Marxist method of understanding, interpreting and acting upon contemporary history.\\\\n\\\\u2018The whole aim of my analysis was to try and reconstruct the unity of Trotsky\\\\u2019s thought and practice as a Marxist: its singular character and coherence. Mandel\\\\u2019s reply renounces any attempt to seek such a unity,\\\\u2019 writes Krass\\\\u00f3.footnote2 In other words: Krass\\\\u00f3 tries to view Trotsky\\\\u2019s thought and practice as a totality governed by some basic principles which he seeks to discover. Any refusal to answer him on the same level\\\\u2014either to accept his definition of the uniqueness of Trotsky\\\\u2019s Marxism, or to substitute another \\\\u2018basic principle\\\\u2019 for his own to interpret Trotsky\\\\u2014is condemned as \\\\u2018empiricism\\\\u2019.\\\\nWe shall come back at the end of this essay to what we consider the differentia specifica of Trotsky\\\\u2019s Marxism. But let us first take Krass\\\\u00f3\\\\u2019s theoretical argument for what it is worth. From the point of view of Marxian dialectics, processes are governed not by basic ideas but by conflicting forces. Any historical process is governed by basic contradictions of a social nature. To conceive of a life-process essentially ruled and explained by ideas is to take a step backward from Marx to Hegel. To view these ideas as immutable, permanent and unrelated either to their inner contradictions or to the contradictions between them and living practice is to take a step backward from Hegel to Kant.\\\\nTo assume that Trotsky\\\\u2019s life constitutes a \\\\u2018unity\\\\u2019 the key of which is an ideological \\\\u2018conception\\\\u2019; to identify that conception with the original sin of \\\\u2018sociologism\\\\u2019; to deny the historical fact that, after joining the Bolshevik party, Trotsky attached the greatest importance to the role of the \\\\u2018subjective factor\\\\u2019 in history and politics, became the staunchest defender of the Leninist theory of the party, and gave us, both as a politician and a historian, some of the finest examples of precise understanding of the \\\\u2018autonomous role of political institutions\\\\u2019 is to advance an \\\\u2018explanation\\\\u2019 for Trotsky\\\\u2019s Marxism which flies in the face of truth.

              " '{\"text\": \"One of the things that puts people off baking at home is the amount of time that it seems to take. Everyone loves the smell of freshly baked bread, and the idea of baking your own loaves, but the time involved can seem overwhelming. That is the attraction of bread machines and \\\\u2018quick loaves\\\\u2019 I suspect, but the danger is that the disappointment that frequently ensues from the resulting loaves puts people off altogether.\\\\nFor sourdough loaves that might need to prove for up to 8 hours it can seem difficult to imagine just how anyone with family or work commitments could possibly fit it in to their lives. In this blog I will work to dispel that fear.\\\\nIn fact sourdough is substantially easier to fit around a busy life than yeast-based loaves. The timings are considerably more flexible. The main trick is to plan ahead. It is clearly not possible to decide in the morning that you would like a fresh sourdough loaf for lunch unless you already have a dough mixed and proving.\\\\nWhat follows are a couple of different suggested timetables for sourdough baking. They follow the same principles used in the other tutorials. Have a look at the slashing and baking tutorial for a description of baking a 100% sourdough loaf, and have a look at the proving tutorial for a description of proving and using the fridge. I have given timings for Saturday baking, but obviously you can adjust them to suit your own life and when you have time to bake.\\\\nThe above timetable gives the most reliable and consistent results, but has the disadvantage that it produces a loaf in the evening, and needs you be around the house (even if in and out) for much of the day. I don\\\\u2019t manage it that often.\\\\nThe above is reliable and effective, and has the advantage of a fairly long period of dough development in the fridge giving a more intensely sour flavour (the version below extends this even further). It can be a bit tricky to get the timing of baking right after the dough has come out of the fridge. The overnight prove is perhaps equivalent to 2 hours of proving at room temperature, but the dough has to return to temperature in the morning before it will rise.\\\\nIf life is busy it can be hard to even find the time to fold dough after work. You can also reduce the wait in the morning, by baking as soon as the oven has warmed up. This schedule involves a minimum of time, and will produce a great tasting sourdough loaf, albeit the structure of the loaf won\\\\u2019t be as good. The loaf is a bit underproved, but it doesn\\\\u2019t matter too much.\\\\nIf you have small children (who drag you out of bed early), or are a natural early riser, then it is possible to have bread for a late breakfast using this schedule.\\\\nHaving a fresh loaf ready to eat first thing is tricky. Given that you need at least 3/4 hour to warm up your oven, 3/4 hour to bake, and 3/4 hour to cool before eating, it is hard to have a loaf baked in time. So if you turn the oven on at 6, you can have a loaf ready to eat by 8.15.\\\\nBake the loaf from the fridge (as in the no-time schedule). This means accepting a less than perfect crumb structure, but being compensated by fresh bread for breakfast, without needing to get up in the night!\\\\nOf course the above schedules are only a couple of possible permutations. There are all sorts of variations that you might need depending upon the activity of your starter, the temperature where you are baking, and the recipe that you are using (not to mention the pressures of life, family and work). They are really just designed to illustrate how flexible sourdough baking can be, and how it can be adapted to ordinary life.\\\\nWhile your intention is to give home bakers flexibility in scheduling, I believe your timetables will also contribute to improved flavours of the sourdough loaves due to delayed fermentation done in the home refrigerator. Thank You.\\\\nYou make gorgeous breads...I\\'ve bookmarked your blog. YUM!\\\\nGorgeous Christmas cake you\\'ve got there on your album. And stollen and figgypud! I see that we have the same tastes. And pork floss bun! Haven\\'t seen that for a while.\\\\nI have read about your breads on \\\\\"The Fresh Loaf\\\\\". They always look so wonderful, I don\\'t know if I have ever commented.\\\\nI don\\'t ever remembering us discussing Dom\\'s timetables. The only place that I remember anything like them is in \\\\\"Local Breads\\\\\". In \\\\\"Local Breads\\\\\" Daniel Leader says if you run out of time stick the dough in the fridge. He is a bit more detailed than that but I have been using the fridge for a while now. It certainly makes baking easy to fit into my schedule.\\\\nI have been a member of Sourdough Companion for over six months but did not know there was a forum for discussion for users until the other day when I was buying a book by John Downes on the site. A crumb shot of Johnny\\'s Ciabatta Integrale caught my attention and it all started from there. I am very happy to learn that members can blog their breads and post recipes, etc., for discussion on the site. Doesn\\'t Australia have one of the most conducive environment for home sourdough making, not the least because Australia is such a great DIY country?! My husband is great handy man. Making bread, especially by hand, is such a satisfying handy man (and woman)\\'s job, isn\\'t it.\\\\nSo I guess I\\'ve caught the bug.

              " '{\"text\": \"What gets injured in a fingertip injury?\\\\nInjured components may include skin, bone, nail, nailbed, tendon, and the pulp, the padded area of the fingertip (see Figure 1). The skin on the palm side of our fingertips is specialized in that it has many more nerve endings than most other parts of our body. These nerve endings enable the fine sensation we have in our fingertips, and they can also be damaged. When this specialized skin is injured, exact replacement may be difficult.\\\\nFingertip injuries are one of the more common injuries in the hand. The fingertips are exposed in many of our activities. They can be crushed, such as by a closing door, a hammer, or a heavy object dropped onto the finger. They can be cut with a knife or power tool, such as a saw, sander, lawnmower, or snowblower.\\\\nIt is important to know how the injury occurred, and about any medical problems, as these can factor into deciding about treatment. Examination reveals the extent of tissue injury and its size. Sensation and circulation of the tip are assessed. Mobility of the tip is also checked, as injuries can occur to the tendons that bend or straighten the fingertip (see web pages on extensor tendon and flexor tendon injuries). X-rays are often needed to see if the bone has been injured.\\\\nSevere crush or avulsion injuries can completely remove some or all of the tissue at the fingertip. If just skin is removed and the defect is less than a centimeter in diameter, it is often possible to treat these injuries with simple dressing changes. If there is a little bit of bone exposed at the tip, it can sometimes be trimmed back slightly and treated with dressings, too. For larger skin defects, skin grafting is occasionally recommended. Smaller grafts can be obtained from the little finger side of the hand. Larger grafts may be harvested from the forearm or groin. If the nailbed is injured, it is repaired (see web page on nailbed injuries).\\\\nWhen patients lose more than skin and have exposed bone, the injury may need to be covered with a flap of skin that has some soft tissue with it for padding. Small wounds on the tip of the finger may be covered with a flap from the injured finger. Larger wounds, such as those that result in substantial loss of the pulp, require a flap that is elevated from an adjacent finger (see Figure 2) or other source. The flap remains attached to its original site so that it has blood supply while it is stitched to the finger wound. A skin graft is used to cover the donor site defect. After a few weeks the flap has sufficient blood supply coming from the injured finger as it heals into its new location, and can be divided from its origin and fully set into the wound.\\\\nFractures of the bone in the tip of the finger are common. Very small fractures of the end or tuft of the bone usually do not affect the strength of the bone. Repair of the soft tissue, such as the nail bed, usually re-aligns and stabilizes these bone fragments. Fractures closer to the joint may require a splint or even a temporary metal pin(s) to hold the bone fragments in proper position. If the damage is too severe, amputation of the fingertip may be necessary.\\\\nFingertip sensitivity is common and may last for many months. Sometimes the feeling in the fingertip is limited. The contour may have some distortion, and the quality and texture of the skin may be different than the very specialized skin that normally covers the fingertip. There also may be some deformity at the donor site of a graft or flap. Stiffness can be a concern, especially if a flap is needed.\\\\nIf there is a nailbed injury that is sharp and can be repaired, a normal nail is likely. If there is more severe crushing of the nail bed, then there is a greater likelihood of nail bed scarring and subsequent deformity of the nail (see brochure or web page on Nailbed Injuries).\"}\\n',\n",

It\\'s vital to know how to choose the right hairbrush but it\\'s also vital to know how to always keep it in top condition and keep it clean. It\\'s best to do some things daily when cleaning brushes in addition to other extra but also essential tasks. In this OneHowTo article we explain in detail how to clean a hairbrush at home.\\\\nHair brushes should be kept clean and in perfect condition, to prevent them from accumulating dirt and becoming transmitters of germs. Every time you brush you should remove any hairs that have accumulated.\\\\nA toothed comb can help to eliminate hairs from your brush, especially if it\\'s a round brush. We recommend that you put any hair straight into the bin rather than the toilet, so it doesn\\'t clog it up.\\\\nAs well as this daily task, you need to clean your hair brush more thoroughly and often. For that, submerge it in hot water with some neutral soap or detergent. You can use any bathroom soap or dishwasher detergent and leave it under water for at least 20-30 minutes.\\\\nOnce done, use a pointed or narrow object to reach all corners of the hairbrush, such as a toothpick or an old toothbrush. This way you\\'ll remove any dirt. However, if your brushes are made of wood you should not submerge them to prevent them from deteriorating. In this case you should rinse it over water and carefully lather some shampoo on it and clear it off with water.\\\\nRinse your brush with clean water and leave it to dry on a dry towel or cloth. Do not brush your hair until the brush is completely dry.\\\\nOccasionally wash your hairbrush with water and ammonia to completely remove any dirt. You must be very careful because it is a corrosive product.\\\\nAnother trick for cleaning hair brushes involves covering them with shaving foam and leaving them for 30 minutes. Rinse afterwards in cool water and you\\'ll find you have a clean, perfect brush.\\\\nIf there are lots of tangled hairs in your brush and can\\'t remove them with the method mentioned above, find some scissors and simply cut through the ball of hair to make sure you can pull them out of the bristles and proceed cleaning with hot water.\\\\nIf you want to read similar articles to How To Clean A Hairbrush At Home, we recommend you visit our Beauty & Personal Care category.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"On December 31st 2017 at 12pm Germany officially shutdown the Gundremmingen B boiling water reactor in Southern Germany, ending its 33 years of operation. This move comes as part of a policy to permanently wean the German power grid away from nuclear power and onto more sustainable and safe sources.\\\\nThis has not always been the policy of Angela Merkel\\\\u2019s government. In September 2010, the German government agreed to extend the licenses of several nuclear reactors by between 8 to14 years. Maintaining Germany\\\\u2019s reliance on nuclear power for, at the time, about one quarter of its energy. By May 2011, this policy had been totally reversed with Merkel\\\\u2019s government reviving the previous government phase-out plan and declaring that Germany would be nuclear free by 2022.\\\\nWhy the reversal? In March 2011, a catastrophic disaster at a nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan led to the release of large amounts of fallout into the air and the evacuation of 170,000 people from their homes. The contaminated area covered an estimated 8% of the Japanese landmass and a 12 mile exclusion zone was enforced. Much of this zone is still heavily contaminated and tens of thousands of people are still unable to return to their homes. In Germany, public reaction to the disaster caused opinion to shift strongly against nuclear power with large protests across the country. In the city of Stuttgart, 40,000 protesters formed a 28 mile human chain to the nuclear plant outside the city demonstrating their opposition to plans to extend the life-time of the plant. Recognising the dangers of nuclear power and the benefits of renewable energy sources, the German government created an ambitious plan to totally reverse nuclear power and provide 80% of Germany\\\\u2019s power through renewables.\\\\nContrasting this, Theresa May\\\\u2019s government is continuing to press forward with plans to expand the Hinkley Point nuclear site with reactor C. This is a dangerous and financially irresponsible policy. So far, work at Hinkley Point C has proceeded at a glacial pace and its estimated cost has skyrocketed. Currently, Hinkley Point C is expected to cost the British energy consumer \\\\u00a330 billion but this number could rise. With construction not even completely underway this figure can be expected to rise even further. Even the Government\\\\u2019s major partner in the project, EDF energy, have demonstrated reservations. A former finance director at EDF described the project as \\\\u2018a house of cards\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018very risky\\\\u2019. The National Audit Office drew similar conclusions calling the project a \\\\u2018risky and expensive project with uncertain strategic and economic benefits\\\\u2019. The financial implications of the reactor are clear; it is a dangerous and fruitless project which will cost the British consumer astounding amounts of money for little gain.\\\\nThe dangers of Hinkley Point are not just fiscal however. A disaster like the one at Fukushima in 2011 could cause a large number of people to lose their homes and an unprecedented environmental disaster. The position of Hinkley Point means that a radioactive plume stemming from an accident at the plant could engulf both Cardiff and Bristol, as well as the major towns and hundreds of rural communities between them. Evacuations would be the tip of the iceberg if an accident like this occurred. Radioactive fallout, like that seen at Fukushima, could make the area uninhabitable for decades and permanently increase the risk of thyroid cancers, leukemia and solid cancers for residents returning to their homes. The ecology of the area would be devastated and crops and livestock would be contaminated. Pro-nuclear arguments have stated that the risk of an accident is low and whilst this is true, Germany, with an impeccable record of industrial safety has realised the dangers of nuclear power and committed to renewables.\\\\n2017 was the greenest on record for energy and renewable sources provide more power to the U.K than ever before. This should serve as a reminder that Hinkley Point is not the only option for the Government. Renewable energy such as Solar, Wind and Tidal have become increasingly cheaper since planning for Hinkley Point C began and safety risks are minimal.. It is still estimated that reversing Hinkley Point and investing in renewables would still cost the government less than committing to its construction and create a safer long term power source for the U.K. Britain should follow the German example and say \\\\u2018AtomKraft? Nein Danke\\\\u2019 \\\\u2018Atomic Energy? No thanks\\\\u2019.\"}\\n',\n",

However, with most other loans you are expected to make regular monthly payments and so you will need to make sure that these are low enough for you to be able to afford. You should be able to easily find out how much the repayments will be before you sign up to the loan and that will help you to decide whether you can afford it. If the interest rate is variable though, the cost of the loan will go up if the base rate increases and so you need to be aware of this and make sure that you are confident that you will still be able to afford the loan in this situation.\\\\nRepayment quantity \\\\u2013 the amounts of repayments is also something that you should be considering. If you will have repayments over a long time, then you have to think harder about whether you will be able to afford to continue to repay them over the long term. It is much easier to predict what your income might be like in the short term compared with the long term and therefore if you have just a small income and have concerns about repayments, it could be better to make sure that the loan you take out only has a small amount of repayments.\\\\nSize of loan \\\\u2013 the size of the loan is really important as well. It is always wise to only borrow the amount of money that you need and nothing more. However, it is worth thinking about how much you can afford to repay as well. You need to consider that you will have to pay interest on all of the money that you borrow and so you will be best to borrow the lowest amount that you can. If you have a small income you are taking even more of a risk by taking out a loan and so you need to be even more careful with the amount that you borrow.\\\\nFlexibility \\\\u2013 it can be worth considering how flexible the lender is or that loan is. You may find that because you have a small income that you will be more likely to find it hard to manage the repayments. You may feel that you want a flexible loan so that you can negotiate a payment holiday or a smaller repayment if you do struggle like this.\\\\nSo although a small income may make you nervous of taking a loan, as long as you consider things that you can do to reduce the risk, you should still be able to feel confident in getting one. You will need to think carefully about how you will manage the repayments for the loan though and make sure that you can afford to do this or think about ways that you will make the repayments more easily affordable for you. Also consider the size of the loan and make sure that it is a size that you can manage and think about how flexible you might need it to be.\\\\nNext Next post: Is it Worth Consolidating my Debts?\"}\\n',\n",

For more information on the Conference visit ciudadesytransporte.org.\\\\nThe responsibility of government is to safeguard the assets of a nation, including forests, beaches and roads\\\\u2014but above all: the citizens. To protect its people, the Mexican government has developed the Mexican Official Regulation, or NOM (the term used in Spanish).\\\\nIn short, NOMs regulate the construction of infrastructure, provide procedures for toxic waste disposal, and set quality standards for goods sold in the country. The ultimate goal of these regulations is to make Mexico a safer place to live; however, the NOMs have a critical fault: they fail to offer any mandatory guidelines for the construction of sidewalks. Instead, sidewalks are built according to cities\\\\u2019 local bylaws. Consequently, Mexican sidewalks are a patchwork of various designs, with quality ranging from good to terrible. It\\\\u2019s time for the Mexican government to address the issue by providing guidelines for sidewalk construction in its NOM framework.\\\\nAt first glance, the NOMs seem expansive enough to cover the construction of sidewalks. After all, they actively regulate the requirements, specifications, procedures and methodology for goods and services offered in the country. Furthermore, unlike the Mexican Standards (NMX in Spanish), NOMs are mandatory.\\\\nHowever, in the field of urban infrastructure, not all contracted projects carried out by the three levels of the Mexican government are subject to NOM. Indeed, many public construction projects\\\\u2014like sidewalks\\\\u2014are allowed to be wholly designed by the contractors themselves, without being subject to a regulatory framework. This loophole is the product of a broader social agreement that encourages minimum regulation on the development of Mexican cities. That\\\\u2019s why we often see sidewalks of varying sizes, shapes, materials and elevations. Unfortunately, many sidewalks fail to ensure the safety and mobility of pedestrians, according to the Pedestrian League (Liga Peatonal) and mobility activists in the country.\\\\nAlthough they receive considerably less attention than roads, sidewalks play a pivotal role in the development of sustainable cities. If built properly, they create safe spaces for pedestrians, boost mobility, improve the local economy and better the quality of life of residents. However, in Mexico, 43 people are killed every day in car crashes, with pedestrians being the most vulnerable group on the road (22 pedestrians are killed daily). These reasons are why the Pedestrian League and other activist groups are demanding a NOM regulating the construction of sidewalks across Mexico. Having a framework for creating quality sidewalks will help make Mexico\\\\u2019s cities more people-focused, will provide safer and universally accessible spaces for pedestrians and will encourage citizens to walk instead of relying on personal vehicles. Furthermore, well-built sidewalks are critical for the creation of public spaces, and encourages citizens to be more physically active.\\\\nStandardized sidewalks are especially important for citizens with disabilities. Without proper regulation, sidewalks in Mexico are often inaccessible to citizens in wheelchairs, forcing them to find alternatives or simply avoid some public areas. Moreover, residents with visual impairments and blindness greatly benefit when sidewalk construction is consistent and even. While poor sidewalks are an inconvenience to able-bodied citizens, they can be entirely inaccessible to people with disabilities.\\\\nSimply put, sidewalks and walkways need to be based upon basic and mandatory criteria that ensure their quality and accessibility. NOMs can be a great solution for achieving this.\\\\nFor more on this discussion, follow the \\\\u201c#NOMBanquetas panel: how to generate mobility rules in Mexico?\\\\u201d on Monday October 12, 24:30 at the World Trade Center in the XI International Conference on Cities and Transport.\"}\\n',\n",

He said bike kiosks would be better located in street spaces painted yellow or red, if the city\\\\u2019s traffic and engineering departments would agree to it.\\\\nLJVMA board members are still grappling with how to ascertain which businesses have paid for a city-issued business tax certificate (formerly business license), a portion of which funds the LJVMA\\\\u2019s efforts to boost business in the Village. Fortune said LJVMA\\\\u2019s fact-finding mission has other San Diego business improvement district groups conducting their own inventories to regain lost funds.\\\\n\\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re even looking at getting a grant for some college students this summer to help us canvas all of our businesses so we can really get a handle on this, because there\\\\u2019s a lot of money that is not being collected or distributed,\\\\u201d Fortune said.\\\\nThe information will be reported to the city treasurer\\\\u2019s office, which will seek payment from non-compliant businesses.\\\\n\\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re operating on shoestrings when we could do so much more,\\\\u201d Marengo added of the lost revenue, which he said the LJVMA could use to hire a person to oversee cleaning the streets of the Village, and to take inventory of items that need to be addressed, such as maintenance of the LJVMA\\\\u2019s donor benches and plants and trees in the common area.\\\\nFortune said she has reached out to an organization that offers employment to adults with developmental challenges to \\\\u201cpossibly do some sidewalk cleanup.\\\\u201d The volunteers would wear a vest identifying their affiliation with the LJVMA.\\\\nBidding opened for businesses wishing to procure one of 60 spots on the LJVMA\\\\u2019s Monopoly-style \\\\u201cLa JollaOpoly\\\\u201d board game, which will raise money for the merchants group and its efforts.\\\\nAbout 1,500 copies of the game are being produced, and will be available for sale at the La Jolla Village Information Center at 1162 Prospect St. and at Village businesses by the start of the summer tourist season.

Reiter Law Firm \\\\u00bb Other Serious Injuries \\\\u00bb Are Commuter Trains Becoming More Dangerous?\\\\nNew York City, NY \\\\u2013 Top attorney, handles MTA, bus accidents, wrongful death, medical malpractice, doctor errors, airline injuries & death, & construction cases. Attorney Jonathan C. Reiter consistently delivers results.\\\\nFor people who live in busy urban areas like New York City and the surrounding major cities, rail travel is often the fastest and most affordable way to commute to work or into the city. However, a number of high profile derailments have occurred in recent years. Understandably, many people worry that trains have become more dangerous.\\\\nHow Many People Travel by Train?\\\\nAccording to a Washington Post report, Amtrak is the busiest passenger train company in the United States, with about 11.6 million riders in the Northeast region alone \\\\u2014 a figure that makes up around one-third of all rail travel in the country. Across the U.S., there are about 31.2 million train passengers each year.\\\\nWhile the U.S. doesn\\\\u2019t have the robust rail systems often found in European countries and parts of Asia, experts say that rail travel in this country is undergoing something of a renaissance.\\\\nThe number of Amtrak riders increased by 55 percent between 1997 and 2012. Among all passengers, 88 percent start or stop their journey in one of 100 of the country\\\\u2019s largest metropolitan areas.\\\\nExperts say the number of rail passengers is only likely to increase. While fuel prices fluctuate and have been down in recent years, the cost of fuel is a significant factor in many people\\\\u2019s decision to commute by train.\\\\nAdditionally, owning a car can be a major hassle in the country\\\\u2019s largest cities. Many train passengers say they can also shorten their commute by traveling by rail rather than dealing with traffic jams that can last for hours during rush hour.\\\\nHow Often Do Train Derailments Happen?\\\\nCompared to previous decades, the number of train derailments has actually decreased. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, there were about 31 train derailments per year over the past 10-year period.\\\\nBy contrast, there were 54 train derailments on average per year in the decade immediately preceding the most recent one.\\\\nHowever, rail safety experts say it\\\\u2019s important to consider all of the facts when you look at these figures. Although the number of trail derailments has gone down, the number of people injured during derailments has increased.\\\\nOf course, car travel remains the most dangerous form of travel statistically. While there were over 32,700 fatalities in cars in 2013, there were 891 railway deaths the same year.\\\\nWhen most people think of a train accident, they likely picture a derailment. This thought process is understandable, as these cases frequently involve many cars jumping the tracks, which can lead to a high number of fatalities and serious injuries.\\\\nHowever, there are many different reasons why train accidents happen.\\\\nTrain Employee Negligence \\\\u2013 This category of train accidents can encompass a wide range of negligence. In recent years, a number of serious train accidents have occurred because the train\\\\u2019s conductor was either fatigued, sleep-deprived or not paying attention. Train employee negligence can also happen when a conductor travels at an excessive speed or fails to slow down as the train approaches a curve.\\\\nDerailments \\\\u2013 Train derailments involve a train car or multiple cars jumping the tracks. If this happens during high speeds, the accident and injuries can be catastrophic.\\\\nBad Track Maintenance \\\\u2013 Just as potholes and debris on the highway can cause a car accident, poor track maintenance can lead to a serious railway accident.\\\\nCollision with Another Train \\\\u2013 It\\\\u2019s rare for a train to collide with another train, but these accidents can and do happen. These types of disasters occur more frequently in subway accidents, where it\\\\u2019s common for many trains to run regular routes in close proximity to each other. In 2008, for example, a train operator working for California\\\\u2019s Metrolink caused a head-on collision with a freight train because he was text messaging and missed a red signal requiring him to stop. The accident resulted in 25 deaths and over 100 injuries.\\\\nCollapsed Bridges \\\\u2013 Bridge collapses or structural problems on a bridge can lead to a train accident if the train is en route and the operator is either unaware of the danger or too close to the bridge to make an appropriate stop.\\\\nCollision with a Car on the Tracks \\\\u2013 Train accidents can also occur when a vehicle is parked or stuck on the tracks at a rail crossing. There have been many serious accidents caused by motorists attempting to cross tracks or failing to slow down as a train approaches. In Nevada in 2011, six people were killed, and 16 were injured when a commercial truck struck an Amtrak train at a crossing. According to the investigative report, the truck driver was inattentive and didn\\\\u2019t attempt to brake until he was 300 feet from the crossing.\\\\nIf you have been injured in a train accident in New York City or the surrounding areas, it\\\\u2019s important to work with a mass transit accident lawyer who understands these cases. You have important rights. Your lawyer can help you protect them.\"}\\n',\n",

Digital marketing experts consider email marketing a tried-and-tested method for generating leads. In spite of steep rise in social media platforms, email marketing is still an efficient way to generate leads at a low cost.\\\\nMost of the successful email marketing campaigns don\\\\u2019t just happen by accident. It requires thoughtful consideration of your customers and the creation of valuable content for them for the campaign to succeed. Your headline is your content\\\\u2019s first impression, so it should be relevant, interesting and genuine. The headline of email is not only the content\\\\u2019s first impression, but it\\\\u2019s also a key factor for encouraging clicks and further audience engagement.\\\\nTry not to bombard your customers with too many emails. In general terms, spamming isn\\\\u2019t limited to scams or valueless self-promotion, but it also includes sending too many emails. Your email must contain informative newsletters, initiate promotions, and latest events that entice customers to stay connected to your brand.\\\\nIf you bombard your customers\\\\u2019 inboxes every day, they\\\\u2019ll start hitting \\\\u201cdelete\\\\u201d instead of opening your email. So, don\\\\u2019t go overboard with this.\\\\nGoogle and other search engines give top priority to the content, which answers their searchers\\\\u2019 questions effectively. If your blog post is more geared around solving readers\\\\u2019 problems, it can increase your chances of being found in organic search.\\\\nSo, a blog post containing original and informative content can increase your organic visibility.\\\\nAccording to HubSpot\\\\u2019s benchmark study, if you invest in blogging, you\\\\u2019ll see an average of 4.5 more leads than those who do not get into it.\\\\nCreating content that resonates well with the target audiences is one of the most critical steps to determine the success of content marketing campaigns. That way, knowing your customer is important while creating content in any form.\\\\nBefore creating content, you should research your audience and thoroughly analyze their interests, the challenges they face, where they spend time online and most importantly what will motivate them to take action.\\\\nIf your content lacks a personalized touch, it won\\\\u2019t be able to draw the users\\\\u2019 attention. Creating personalized content can be difficult for market giants like Walmart where the audience is large and varied. But, for everyone else, there is no excuse.\\\\nAfter all, you are getting into content marketing with the intent of taking your brand to the next level. So, your content should be written in a manner that would reflect your Brand. While creating content, you must consider factors that forge a bond between your brand and the customers.\\\\nYou should create content that gives a specific voice to all your company\\\\u2019s external communications. If your content does not reflect your brand voice, then it will not fulfil your marketing goals. So always write the content which will make your brand stand out of the crowd.\\\\nGood content is an important part of your business image. The more people see your content, the better chance for you to gain new customers.

              " '{\"text\": \"You need to know the ropes to make the best out of your real estate sale. The following article will give you expert tips on how to sort out the myriad of confusing choices.\\\\nTry to make your home as neutral and non-personal as possible before putting it on the market. You no longer want it to announce your particular tastes! You can accomplish this by eliminating all family pictures and other personal items. A buyer doesn\\\\u2019t really want to see your family all over the house, they\\\\u2019d rather see their own. You need to de-clutter everything since you want to show them the space, not your stuff.\\\\nWhen it\\\\u2019s time to draw up the listing contract with your agent, carefully choose the terms of sale and selling price. Consider whether including your kitchen appliances and other personal property in the home might increase its value to a potential buyer. You may want to also let them know what you will take with you so they do not expect it to be there when they move in. This needs to be in black and white, so that no one misunderstands the terms.\\\\nSelect your agent with care before selling your home. You should make sure the agent you are working with knows what they are doing. An experienced real estate agent will help ensure that you home is sold quickly and at the best price.\\\\nIf you overprice your house hoping that it will give you more room in negotiating, you will find that it is a wasted effort. Buyers will tend to look past a home that is overpriced. Skip the frustration altogether by simply arriving at an appropriate price from the start.\\\\nWhen you list your house, be certain that its roof is sound. Very few buyers will be willing to buy your home if the roof is in need of repair. If you don\\\\u2019t want to fix your roof for some reason, give potential buyers a money-saving alternative to compensate for the investment they will have to make in having the roof repaired.\\\\nThe more years you spend in a house, the more likely you are to have accumulated a great deal of stuff. People in homes like this often have a hard time understanding what\\\\u2019s clutter and what\\\\u2019s not, since they have grown accustomed to it. Consider bringing somebody on board to help you remove unnecessary clutter. This way your home can be more pleasing when viewed by any potential buyer.\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t think an appraisal is what your home is really worth. There are many variables considered when an appraisal is completed; therefore, you can have two different appraisals done and they may very well have different appraised values. Comparative market analysis can help you receive an accurate price for your home and help you put a better market price on it when it comes time to sell.\\\\nYou can make your home feel fresh by simply cleaning the windows, a little thing like this can make all the difference. Clean windows also tend to let more light inside, making your house feel new again. The benefits will be obvious if you take the time to invest in vigorously cleaning your windows.\\\\nSelling your home will be simpler if you employ a qualified local real estate agent. There are tools to help FSBO sellers manage the complexity, but they do generally eat into the profits from the sale.\\\\nAs we said before, if you know why you are selling your home, you will know if you should do it. The tips provided above included great advice on many factors that are part of the selling process. By following the advice above, you will be able to sell your home easily.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"The purpose of this publication is to raise awareness about the Saugahatchee Creek Watershed, including its geography, ecology, history and future course. The report has been compiled with input from a diverse stakeholder group, including representatives of government, industry, academia and community organizations. It was written as part of a project to develop a comprehensive Saugahatchee Creek Watershed Management Plan, called SWaMP. The project was funded through a Clean Water Act Section 319(h) nonpoint source grant provided by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 4. All interested persons are invited to become personally involved with SWaMP in an effort to restore and protect the Saugahatchee Creek Watershed.\\\\nThe following stakeholders, referred to as the SWaMP Group, were the primary contributors to this report: Auburn University Fisheries Department Alabama Water Watch City of Auburn City of Opelika Lower Tallapoosa Clean Water Partnership MeadWestvaco, Inc. Natural Resources Conservation Service Save Our Saugahatchee, Inc. WestPoint Stevens, Inc.\\\\nThe citizen group, Save Our Saugahatchee, conducting a cleanup of Saugahatchee Creek, April 2000 Cover photos: Top left: Covered bridge formerly at Hayes Mill Crossing, PHOTO: Lee County Historical Society. Top right: Turtles on a rock at Golden Mill Bridge. Bottom center: Saugahatchee Creek at Lee County Road 65. Unlabeled photos and graphics are from the Alabama Water Watch program at Auburn University.\\\\nAlabama is divided into several physiographic regions based on its diverse geology. Nearly all of the Saugahatchee Creek Watershed is in the Piedmont Region (see map below). Piedmont soils are relatively infertile and high in clay (especially red clay) content. This is why Saugahatchee Creek water is often red when sediment enters the creek during heavy rainfalls.\\\\nPeople have inhabited the Saugahatchee Watershed since prehistoric times. Early in the historic era, the indigenous groups were collectively called the Upper Creeks. Names of three major towns in the watershed were derived from the Creek Indian language (see map below). The name &quot;Saugahatchee,&quot; meaning &quot;rattling river,&quot; also came from the Creeks. Several variations of this name have been used: Saugahatchie, Sougahatchee, Souchaghatchee, Sowkeehatchee, Sougohatche.\\\\nEuropeans began exploring the area as early as the 16th century. The Spanish explorer, Hernando De Soto, passed a few miles south of what is now Loachapoka around 1520. In the first half of the 19 century, settlers moved into the watershed in large numbers. The Treaty of Cusseta ceded the Creeks\\' land to the United States in March 1832. Conflicts between the Creeks and the newly arrived settlers increased and this resulted in the forced movement of the majority of the Creeks to allotted land in Oklahoma in late 1836. In this same year Loachapoka became home to European settlers. The towns of Auburn (founded in 1839) and Opelika (founded in 1854) grew rapidly, but Loachapoka became the early center of commerce when the railroad from Montgomery came in 1845. As a result, Loachapoka became much larger than Auburn in the 19th century.\\\\nOther people rightfully point to the fact that our rapidly growing population and its accompanying urban development have more recently impacted the creek with increased sediments and excess runoff of nutrients and other contaminants from the landscape. Thus, the answer to whether the creek has become better or worse depends on one\\'s perspective, the type of impact, and the timeframe.\\\\nRIVER OTTER, Lontra canadensis , is found throughout most of the Saugahatchee Watershed.\\\\nAMERICAN ALLIGATOR, Alligator mississippiensis, occurs in the Saugahatchee Creek, and is regularly seen by canoeists. It is a federally and state protected species.\\\\nLand use in the Saugahatchee Watershed has undergone dramatic changes over the last two centuries, particularly in recent years.\\\\nThe maps above depict land use of the Saugahatchee Watershed derived from Landsat Satellite images. Analysis of the two images revealed significant changes in land use from 1993 to 2001. These changes are presented as a percent of the whole Saugahatchee Watershed in the table to the left. Note that the greatest changes were in Forest (decline of 17%), Transitional Land (increase of 10%) and Urban (increase of 4%). Although much of the forest decline may be temporary, and this land may be replanted in trees, the urban growth will have a lasting effect on watershed condition.\\\\nWhat will the watershed map look like in the future?\\\\nTwo-thirds of the Saugahatchee Watershed is covered by forests which filter and purify water, conserve soil, and enhance wildlife. Much of this forestland is in a regular 40-50 year harvest-replant cycle. Transitional Lands on the land use maps consist mostly of harvested areas and areas in the early stages (1-3 years) of regrowth. The proper use of Forestry Best Management Practices (BMPs) outlined in Alabama\\'s Best Management Practices For Forestry (www.forestry.state.al.us/bmps.htm) should reduce sediment and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) loading from forestlands into Saugahatchee Creek, however, education and vigilance are required to make the benefits of BMPs a reality.\\\\nUrban centers impact water quality by such things as storm water runoff and soil erosion from construction sites. By decreasing tree cover to make room for homes and paved roads (impervious surfaces), water infiltration decreases and runoff often increases. Urban centers also have demanding water needs and produce large volumes of wastewater. As rapid growth continues in the Saugahatchee Watershed, water demands will increase.\\\\nAgriculture in the Saugahatchee Watershed has undergone a dramatic transition in the past 100 years from row crop production (primarily cotton and corn) to pine plantations and pastureland, used for livestock grazing and hay production. In its heyday, cotton occupied as much as 30,000 acres (22%) of the Saugahatchee Watershed. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has developed extensive resources to promote the implementation of Agriculture BMPs that minimize environmental impacts of agricultural activities (www.al.nrcs.usda.gov/technical). More recently, agricultural lands are turning into subdivisions, shopping malls and parking lots.\\\\nAs a result of the 2000 census, the Opelika-Auburn area was designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) indicating that the area now has a population exceeding 100,000. Growth projections estimate that the population in the Opelika-Auburn MSA will increase by 56% from 2000 to 2025 (source: Center for Business and Economic Research, University of Alabama, 2001).\\\\nUrban sprawl or Smart Growth? \\\\u00ad How can Planning Commissions, City Councils, developers, contractors and landowners lessen the negative impacts of urban development on the watershed?\\\\nWith increased population comes increased water consumption and wastewater. Saugahatchee Creek already has two segments impaired by excess nutrients, and stricter discharge regulations (TMDLs) are being developed by ADEM. The cities of Auburn and Opelika, therefore, need to consider alternatives for treating and discharging wastewater to the Saugahatchee. Alternatives include additional facilities, advanced treatment to remove nutrients and moving some treated wastewater from the Saugahatchee to Chewacla Creek (discharge moved from the North Auburn Wastewater Treatment Plant to the South Auburn Plant). The equivalent of about 1,150 dump truck loads of sediment empties into Saugahatchee Creek each year (Auburn University study). Will new erosion and sediment control ordinances and efforts of the ALOA (City of Auburn, Lee County, City of Opelika and Auburn University) Citizen Advisory Group be sufficient to reduce the amount of sediment entering the Creek?\\\\nGranite is a raw material that is abundant in the Saugahatchee Watershed and has been quarried in the past. A new granite quarry was established in 2003 about 2.5 miles west of Loachapoka. This quarry is permitted by the state to operate to within approximately 50 feet of Saugahatchee Creek. How will quarries and mining affect stream water quality and quantity?\\\\nAn increasing amount of the Saugahatchee Watershed is being blanketed with asphalt, concrete and metal (parking lots, roads, driveways, buildings). These materials are impervious surfaces that do not allow water to infiltrate into the soil. As impervious surfaces increase across the watershed, the volume of runoff following a rain event also increases. This increased runoff can cause flooding and increased erosion/sedimentation as well as extensive damage to roads, bridges, stream channels, and habitat of fish and other aquatic organisms. Alternative materials, such as permeable concrete parking areas, are beginning to be installed in the watershed.\\\\nThe southeastern U.S. is a hotspot for plant and animal biodiversity. Alabama is home to about 3,400 plant species, 73 amphibians, 81 reptiles, 420 birds, 180 mussels (59% of North America\\'s mussel species), 320 freshwater fishes (one-third of fishes in the lower 48 states) and 60 mammals. Many of these plants and animals are found in the Saugahatchee Watershed. As urban/suburban development swells municipal boundaries into rural areas, plant and animal habitat shrinks. Soil eroded from barren lands washes into streams and disrupts the habitat of fishes and other aquatic creatures. Invasive species, such as Asian carp, Asian clams and exotic plants (Salvinia molesta, giant water fern) have all been accidentally introduced into Saugahatchee Creek and threaten native species.\\\\nTALLAPOOSA DARTER, Etheostoma tallapoosae, is found only in the Tallapoosa Basin and occurs in Saugahatchee Creek.\\\\nIndustry.

Vertical lines on bars represent the range of values.\\\\nHosting an annual presentation by AWW staff to discuss citizen and agency watershed data to determine if stream water quality is getting better or worse.\\\\nDissolved oxygen trend (blue dashed line). Dissolved oxygen levels at the North Donahue Bridge site on Saugahatchee Creek have improved over the past eight years (www.alabamawaterwatch.org, click on `Water Data\\' link).\\\\nThe City recently constructed the Tacoma Street and White Street Bioretention Facilities. These ponds catch storm runoff and then utilize soil, plants and trees to filter pollutants from the water. The City assisted with the Lee County Water Festival to educate 4th grade students about the importance of conservation of water resources. Approximately 1,500 students attended the first year. The City also expanded its Earth Day celebration to a full week of activities to provide citizens with information and activities related to conservation of our environment. City of Opelika The City of Opelika and its planning jurisdiction encompass much of the headwaters of Saugahatchee Creek. The employees, citizens and associated stakeholders of Opelika are committed to sustainable preservation, which is reflected in four protective efforts: 1) Wastewater treatment. Opelika\\'s wastewater treatment facilities protect water quality throughout the headwaters of Saugahatchee Creek. The wastewater treatment professionals carefully monitor their facilities for maximum efficiency to insure compliance with federal and state water quality standards. 2) Drinking water. The Opelika Utilities Board continues its watershed protection initiatives to guarantee safe, clean drinking water for generations to come. About two-thirds of the city\\'s drinking water comes from Saugahatchee Lake, which lies on the northwest side of town. 3) Storm water management. Opelika partnered with the City of Auburn, Lee County, Auburn University, ADEM and public stakeholders to develop Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) standards that reduce sediment deposition into local streams. ESC standards are now required for all development in the Saugahatchee headwaters.\\\\n4) Management of development. The City has proactively advanced local watershed protection by strengthening development standards in its Subdivision Regulations. These standards protect water quality beyond the city\\'s political boundaries to its three-mile extended planning jurisdiction.\\\\nNatural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) The NRCS is an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that works at the local level to help people conserve soil, water and other natural resources on private lands. The NRCS works with citizens in local Soil and Water Conservation Districts to establish conservation priorities. Activities of the NRCS include: Assisting landowners with water quality improvement projects through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) (www.al.nrcs.usda.gov/programs). Providing technical assistance to landowners to help develop conservation systems uniquely suited to a community or individual farms or ranches (www.al.nrcs.usda.gov/technical). Providing environmental and conservation education programs and materials to students and teachers at schools in the Saugahatchee Watershed. Sponsoring the annual Lee County Water Festival, an interactive educational learning experience consisting of hands-on activities for all fourth-graders in the county.\\\\nNRCS\\'s Ruby Raindrop visits local school to educate children about water conservation.\\\\nWestPoint Stevens, Inc. (WPS) In 1948, Pepperell Manufacturing (later WPS) and the City of Opelika jointly participated in the construction of Saugahatchee Lake to supply water to both the city and WPS Opelika Finishing Plant. In August 2005, WestPoint Home, Inc. (WPH) purchased the assets of WPS and continues to use Saugahatchee Lake as the major source of its process water in Opelika. Currently, all three WPH facilities send their domestic wastewater to the City of Opelika for treatment. A portion of the industrial discharge from the Opelika Finishing and Grifftex plants also goes to the city, while the bulk of the industrial discharge from WPH Opelika Finishing Plant and Opelika Mill is treated onsite and discharged into Pepperell Branch. Non-contact cooling water from Grifftex and all storm water from the entire complex are also discharged into Pepperell Branch.\\\\nWPS continued to improve the efficiency of its wastewater treatment plant, and has recently upgraded cold weather treatment efficiency and color removal. In June 2004, tertiary treatment was added in the form of a twostage constructed wetland system to further improve treatment efficiency and nutrient removal. WPS also took steps to protect the Pepperell Branch corridor downstream of their facility by establishing an environmental buffer zone along a 1.5-mile section of Pepperell Branch. This formal covenant will prevent any further development from encroaching on the riparian zone of Pepperell Branch in this area. WPS partially funded a comprehensive study of Saugahatchee Creek that was conducted by the Auburn University Fisheries Department, to assist ADEM in the development of a TMDL for stream protection. WPS was a charter member of the Lower Tallapoosa River Clean Water Partnership, S.O.S. and the SWaMP group. WPS hosted tours of its wastewater treatment facility for numerous groups and worked closely with S.O.S. on issues that affect the watershed. MeadWestvaco, Inc. MeadWestvaco owns and manages approximately 14,000 acres of forest (about 10% of the total acreage) in the Saugahatchee Watershed to provide pine pulpwood for the production of packaging coated board. The company adheres to Alabama\\'s Forestry Best Management Practices (BMPs), and is a certified member of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. MeadWestvaco\\'s efforts to protect water quality include: Tree harvests are designed to leave undisturbed streamside management zones (SMZ) along intermittent and perennial streams to provide buffers that filter runoff, prevent stream sedimentation and provide stream shading. Loggers are trained to avoid disturbing soil inside SMZs. Harvesting activities are monitored by foresters to ensure compliance with BMPs. Stream crossings and roads are designed, constructed, and managed to prevent soil movement into streams. After-harvest inspections are conducted to ensure that skid trails are properly reclaimed, and that no extensive patches of bare soil remain exposed. Throughout harvest and regeneration, woody residue and organic matter are left on the sites to reduce erosion from bare soil, maintain soil nutrient sources and enhance habitat diversity for wildlife and plants.\\\\nMore than a dozen major scientific studies have been conducted in the Saugahatchee Watershed by universities and government agencies. Early studies focused on heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium and others), DDT and other persistent pesticides (Bayne et al. 1983. Final Report on A Study of the Effects of Environmental Contaminants on Wildlife Populations). Although heavy metals and persistent pesticides were not a problem in the Saugahatchee Creek at that time, high nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), excessive amounts of organic waste from municipal and industrial (point source) discharges and low dissolved oxygen (DO) were reported in the upper reaches of the creek. Current concerns are focused on nonpoint source pollution (runoff from fields, streets, parking lots), particularly erosion and sedimentation, high concentrations of nutrients and organic matter, and low DO. The Auburn University Fisheries Department conducted a comprehensive two-year study during 2001-02 to determine nutrient and sediment loading in Saugahatchee Creek (see report at www.alearn.info/natural-resources/ riversandstreams.php). Findings included: 38 low DO readings (&lt; 5 ppm, the minimum level of DO to support healthy fish and wildlife populations) were recorded in tributaries and the creek, mostly in the upper watershed. Total phosphorus (TP, an important nutrient that promotes proliferation of algae) and total suspended solids (TSS, primarily eroded soil in the water) increased stepwise from the headwaters downstream to Yates Lake (see graph at left). TP was mostly from point sources in the upper watershed, but was from both point and nonpoint sources in the lower watershed. TSS (sediment) was almost entirely from nonpoint sources throughout the watershed.\\\\nTotal phosphorus (TP) and total suspended solids (TSS) loads measured at eight sites on Saugahatchee Creek during 2001-02. Error bars equal \\\\u00b1 standard deviation. 1 metric ton = 1.1 US ton. ADEM sites (Yates-1, Yates-2) are shown on Yates Lake (graph on next page).\\\\nAnalysis of a plant pigment called chlorophyll a (an estimator of algal biomass and the trophic state or enrichment of a waterbody) showed that concentrations in the Saugahatchee Embayment were markedly higher than in Yates Lake. The elevated algal biomass in the embayment, along with high levels of organic matter and low dissolved oxygen, are the primary reasons why this section of the Growing season chlorophyll a concentrations measured in Yates Lake dam Saugahatchee Creek is on forebay (ADEM site Yates-1) and in the Saugahatchee Embayment (ADEM site Yates-2, see map on previous page). 2004 average is of AU and ADEM data, all ADEM\\'s 303(d) list.\\\\nothers are ADEM data. Vertical lines crossing points represent the range of values.\\\\nAt the Saugahatchee Embayment, the flow of the creek slows and the stream nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) are expressed biologically as algae. An algal plume may be seen extending from the embayment into Yates Lake (photo at left). Algal biomass at Yates dam forebay from 1990-2004 has been relatively stable (blue line on graph above), in the lower mesotrophic range (moderate nutrient levels) while the Saugahatchee Embayment values (green line above) have been in the eutrophic range (nutrient-rich with turbid, green waters).\\\\nMajor sources of organic matter in the creek are discharges from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants. Organic matter (or organic enrichment) can be estimated by measuring the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the water. As organic matter decays in water, BOD depletes the stream and lake of dissolved oxygen, which can stress fish and other aquatic organisms. As the population of Auburn and Opelika increases, so does the volume of treated wastewater discharged into Saugahatchee Creek, which in turn has caused increased BOD (see graph at right).\\\\nFour-year trend in BOD in Saugahatchee Creek measured at Lee County Road 188. 2001-02 averages are of AU data, 2004 is of ADEM data. Vertical lines crossing points represent the range of values.\\\\nAlabama Clean Water Partnership (ACWP) The ACWP was created in 2000 to coordinate stakeholders for the restoration and protection of river basins statewide in accordance with the Clean Water Act. The ACWP is a coalition of public and private sectors, companies, civic organizations and governing bodies working together to protect and preserve water resources and aquatic ecosystems. Management plans for the major river basins are being developed that represent the diverse interests of all stakeholders. The basin plans will also include several sub-basin plans. For example, the Tallapoosa Basin Plan is made up of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Sub-basin Plans. The Saugahatchee Watershed Management Plan (SWaMP) was developed as a more specific component of the Lower Tallapoosa Sub-Basin Plan.\\\\nSaugahatchee Watershed Management Group The stakeholder group began meeting in February 2004 to develop a Saugahatchee Watershed Management Plan (SWaMP). The first draft of the Plan was completed and submitted to ADEM in February 2005. Other agencies, such as the Soil and Water Conservation District, Alabama Forestry Commission and Alabama Department of Public Health, are expected to join the SWaMP group and all stakeholders are welcome to participate. Goals of SWaMP Group meeting. PHOTO: Jacob McLean the plan are to reduce nutrient and sediment loads into Saugahatchee Creek in order to restore stream water quality to healthy levels for people, fish and wildlife. Funding to implement the Plan is being pursued from several sources, including ADEM and members of the SWaMP group. All watershed management plans that are implemented with EPA/ADEM funds must address nine elements listed below. These elements provide assurance that nonpoint source pollution load reductions will be achieved, and that public funds to address impaired waters are used effectively. All of these elements have been incorporated into SWaMP. 1. Identification of causes and sources of water pollution problems. 2. Development of load (nutrient and/or sediment) reduction estimates needed to restore the waterbody\\'s water quality. 3. Description of nonpoint source pollution management measures needed in the watershed. 4. Estimation of technical and financial assistance needed to achieve load reductions. 5. Development of an adequate information/education component to the plan. 6. Establishment of an implementation schedule. 7. Establishment of measurable milestones to determine if nonpoint source management measures are yielding desired load reductions. 8. Development of criteria for determining if load reductions are being achieved. 9. Development of a stream and/or lake water quality-monitoring component.\\\\nThe Plan is divided into three general categories of action strategies for watershed management: 1. Assessment/Evaluation of Problems, 2. Rural Strategies, and 3. Urban Strategies.\\\\nInstall stream gages to measure daily flow, along with in-stream nutrient and sediment loading. Analyze streambed sediments from the headwaters of Saugahatchee Creek downstream to Yates Lake to determine nutrient content and sources. Assess condition of urban streams and the potential for remediation if impairments are found.\\\\nIdentify and install terraces, ponds and other structures on farms and pastures for erosion control and reduction of nutrient runoff. Conduct workshops for county employees on BMPs for unpaved road maintenance. Conduct study-tours for private landowners to demonstrate proper forestry BMPs.\\\\nConduct lawn care and landscaping workshops for training in the reduction of sediment, pesticide and nutrient runoff into streams. Revitalize urban forests, especially restoring stream bank vegetation that protects water quality. Establish pilot projects of bioretention ponds and rain gardens for the treatment of storm water runoff.\\\\nof government, industry and the community. steps that are cost-effective and lead to measurable improvements in water quality.\\\\nof elected officials with the authority to institutionalize a sustainable watershed management plan. What is the future for the Saugahatchee Creek Watershed? We know that population growth will increase for several years, leading to significant changes in the watershed. The creek will continue to be vital for the development of Auburn, Opelika and other communities within the watershed, providing drinking water, wastewater treatment, irrigation, recreational opportunities, and other important functions. Decisions made today will affect the condition of the watershed in the future.\\\\nWhat is in the future of Saugahatchee Creek?\"}\\n',\n",

People of goodwill from both sides of the conversation can agree that 1 million abortions a year are 1 million abortions too many. We wanted to make sure that the Obama administration knew this was one of our highest priorities.\\\\\"\\\\nYet, when Salt was asked if Catholics United planned to hold Obama accountable for his pledge to work to reduce abortions, he was cautious. \\\\\"We\\'re hopeful that the Obama administration is with us on abortion reduction. We were not there to make asks, but rather to build consensus around real solutions.\\\\\"\\\\nSalt also added that no one raised the issue of Obama overturning the Mexico City Policy, which prevents American aid from going to those who counsel women on the availability of abortion.\\\\nAlexia Kelley, Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, informed CNA that there are \\\\\"many efforts underway and planned\\\\\" to show support for the incoming administration as well as to challenge it to keep its abortion reducing commitment.\\\\nAdditionally, Kelley mentioned that the topics of how to help the poor, homeless, children and the sick during these times of economic hardship were also raised.\\\\nBoth Salt and Kelley confirmed to CNA that there was no one officially representing the Catholic Church present at the meeting, although they thought that an Obama team representative had met with key bishops at the USCCB.\\\\nBishop Thomas Wenski, a member of the U.S. Bishops\\\\u2019 Committee on International Justice and Peace, reacted to the meeting by saying, \\\\\"while the Obama transition team is free to meet with anyone they wish\\\\u2026the fact is that the only ones who speak for the Catholic Church are the bishops.\\\\n\\\\\"If the transition team wished to telegraph a message that their intention is to marginalize the bishops then there is reason for some serious concern regarding the relationship between the future Obama administration and this nation\\'s 60 million Catholics,\\\\\" Wenski said.\\\\nCatholic scholar and author George Weigel expressed his doubts about the meeting\\\\u2019s make up. \\\\\"If the Obama transition team thinks that meeting with the refugees from the Catholic revolution that never was is a way to open a dialogue with the Catholic Church in the United States, they\\'re far less clever than I think they are. This strikes me as simply a pay-off to people who, from the Obama campaign\\'s point of view, helped with the ground game in 2008.\\\\\"\\\\nThe proof of the social justice groups\\\\u2019 commitment to promoting Catholic concerns will be in \\\\\"how these \\\\u2018Platform for the Common Good\\\\u2019 folks help the rest of the Catholic Church defeat the Freedom of Choice Act and maintain the Bush administration\\'s AIDS and malaria-reduction initiatives in Africa, which has helped millions more poor people than any of these groups has ever managed to do,\\\\\" Weigel explained to CNA.\\\\nBishop of Madison Robert Morlino also added that the transition team must do more to dialogue with the Catholic Church. \\\\\"Recognizing the stark contrast between the positions on abortion of the President-elect and the teachings of the Catholic Church, it would be a mistake for the President-elect\\'s transition team to pretend that this meeting satisfied his promise of dialoguing with the Catholic community,\\\\\" he said.\\\\nThe bishop of Phoenix, Thomas Olmsted, also weighed-in on the meeting by addressing what a Catholic organization should be emphasizing. He told CNA that \\\\u201cBeing \\'right\\' on any number of other issues will never outweigh the taking of human life through abortion. It would be my hope that any group calling themselves \\'Catholic\\' would make this message abundantly clear, and express grave concern over the possibilities that the new administration may increase funding for abortions with public money or even erode conscience protections for Catholic hospitals and healthcare workers.\\\\\"\\\\nFinally, Brian Burch, who heads a group of four lay Catholic organizations in the political, legal, research and educational fields, also expressed misgivings about the ability of the social justice consortium to rein in Obama\\\\u2019s policies.\\\\n\\\\\"We are pleased to hear that the Obama transition team is interested in talking with Catholics, but caution that such conversations must be weighed against his reported plans on abortion policy, including his Cabinet selections thus far. Specifically, we remain concerned that the new Administration is composed of leading abortion advocates who are preparing to overturn a large number of existing pro-life laws, while proving hundreds of millions of new taxpayer dollars for abortion.\\\\n\\\\\"The fact that transition officials are consulting a select group of Catholic organizations who supported Obama\\'s candidacy is not surprising. Whether these groups, some of whom claim to adhere to Catholic teaching, are able to hold him accountable on the issue of life, remains doubtful.\\\\\"\"}\\n',\n",

Which gives it a lot in common with Clickfunnels Not Updating.\\\\nConcerning flexibility, there\\\\u2019s absolutely not any comparison between ClickFunnel\\\\u2019s drag and drop editor and SamCart\\\\u2019s Clickfunnels O Que \\\\u00c9.\\\\nSamCart does permit you to add order bumps, upsells and downsells such as Clickfunnels Not Updating does. You can also quickly create coupons for your products which is just another terrific way to increase conversions.\\\\nHowever, where Samcart is missing, is the capability to capture leads and build complete sales funnels. The products come in at the same $97 a month price point, and I find Clickfunnels Not Updating to be quite a bit more flexible and powerful than Samcart.\\\\nOtherwise, Clickfunnels Not Updating could be overkill for you.

              " '{\"text\": \"In this set of articles (in no particular order) we\\\\u2019re going to talk about some of the trends that tangibly impact our End User Computing industry today or tomorrow for the bulk of our use cases across the world. The first trend we will discuss is Hyper-convergence.\\\\nEvery year or so the leading analysts of our industries (I\\\\u2019m looking at your Gartner, Forrester and IDC) come up with new (mega)trends that will disrupt our industry. Since I\\\\u2019m a no-nonsense kind of guy (being Dutch will do that to you) it often feels like hot air. They usually start first in the consumer space and later bleed over into the enterprise space, in this case End User Computing - the textbook example of the effects of Consumerization of IT. Smartphones are an often used example but AppStores are a good example too. Consider that the Apple AppStore launched in 2008 and today, slowly, we are seeing AppStores being adopted more and more in Enterprises\\\\u20137 years later.\\\\nThis year however and next year a lot of these (sub)trends will have a tangible impact on your End User Computing work and in this article I want to share some of that impact with you.\\\\nIn this set of articles (in no particular order) we\\\\u2019re going to talk about some of the trends that tangibly impact our industry today or tomorrow for the bulk of our use cases across the world. I specifically say across the world because there are still very different new tech adoption cycles across the world. Typically, the US is the first to adopt new(er)technologies followed by Northern Europe about 1-2 years later. APACJ usually follows 1-2 years after that, followed by the rest of the civilized world (I\\\\u2019ll leave it to yourself to define civilized). Also know this article is not about the Workspace of 2020 and beyond where you might talk to Siri/Cortana/Echo/GoogleNow to get your work done and have your lunch in virtual reality, so keep that in mind.\\\\nThe first trend I want to explore is hyper-convergence and how it will affect our industry in the coming years for the bulk of the use cases around the world.\\\\nI\\\\u2019ll start of by saying that I am not a hardware guy. Trust me, I know. I worked (full disclosure) at a company that is big on hardware, and I can decisively say I am not a hardware guy. Ironically, the fact that I am not a hardware guy actually proves the impact that hyper-convergence has on the End User Computing industry. Let\\\\u2019s face it, the important parts of End User Computing are about software, not about hardware.\\\\nThat is, except for desktop virtualization.\\\\nPretty soon after VDI started to become popular, many admins would wake up screaming four letters in the middle of the night. You guessed it: IOPS! The storage wars ensued and all of a sudden one had to be a storage expert to be able to host virtual desktops successfully at any scale. That\\\\u2019s just silly. It would be the same if you were expected to be able piece together your own engine if you wanted to drive a car. IT departments want to focus on delivering the perfect workspace with the right applications, data, security, etc.\\\\u2013not what the write penalty will would be with Office 2016 and RAID 10+11-5. As it turns out, many of the vendors in the hyper-converged space feel the same way.\\\\nMany of the vendors in the hyper-converged space have a made their early success in desktop virtualization. That makes sense because desktop virtualization, or more specifically VDI, provided unique challenges for the storage that already existed in most datacenters at the time. VDI requires more storage and more IOPS with very high peaks and deep valleys.\\\\nSince the good hyper-converged vendors (in my mind) are really about software, they\\\\u2019ve been in a good position to solve the \\\\u2018VDI storage problem\\\\u2019 with software-based features like: (inline) deduplication, storage tiering, compression, read caching, and write optimizations. Additionally, these hyper-converged vendors often offer easy ways to get high availability and DR that make the whole persistent vs non-persistent VDI debate a lot less hard from a cost perspective (the management part of it is a separate story). Another great benefit hyper-convergence is how easy it is to scale up (often refered to as Web-scale IT). All you need to do is add another unit/node to get X% more capacity while still managing it all from the same interface. According to the hyper-converged vendors this can be done at a lower cost than \\\\u2018traditional\\\\u2019 solutions.\\\\nIf you decide that desktop virtualization is part of your End User Computing strategy, then you should not have to worry about the physical hardware. This is what hyper-convergence in End User Computing is all about to me. Two of my personal favorites are Atlantis Computing and Nutanix.\\\\nAtlantis Computing most certainly is a great example of a company that had their early success in VDI and most certainly have the right DNA. I remember back in 2008 when I was at Provision we talked to Atlantis about integrating with ILIO (which actually had layering capabilities as well!). Actually, it is only fairly recent that Atlantis entered the hyper-converged space with their announcement of their HyperScale hardware platformearlier in 2015.\\\\nWhile Nutanix is more of a new player compared to the old-guard of storage (shipping their first hyper-converged product in 2011) they have seen has seen some amazing growth (they are one of those \\\\u2018Unicorns\\\\u2019) and have a valuation of $2B+. What I like about Nutanix are their management capabilities and their drive to make both the datacenter infrastructure and the virtualization infrastructure \\\\u2018invisible.\\\\u2019 Of course, keep in mind that these are just two companies of dozens more.\\\\nI think we will see hyper-converged hardware having a big impact in End User Computing projects because of the increased mindshare, commoditization, and lower prices due to increasing competition in this space. Additionally, many people are learning that other workloads in the datacenter will choose hyper-converged.\"}\\n',\n",

If we have a bigger vision of what education can and should look like, then our decisions are driven by that vision and not steered by emotion (in the heat of the moment), which causes rapid, spur-of-the-moment decision making.\\\\nI have seen far too many principals make far too many decisions on the fly because of a lack of vision and/or a failure to control emotions.

She was very helpful and I would recommend Christina Bailey & Liz Clark to anyone!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Christina Bailey was great to work with she help me with buying my first house and she made sure everything went smooth. I would recommend her to help you find your home\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Thank you! We are so thankful that Abby was available to list our home in Harrisburg. She was our agent when we bought it and did a great job, then! Abby really has gone above and beyond with this listing. We called her from out of state, Kevin from Arkansas and myself from Tennessee. We made a key available to her and she installed a lock box the very next day. She advised us that by using a professional photographer how much better the listing would appeal to potential buyers. She was spot on! I made a joke to her that I would even buy our house! Abby even went the extra mile and tidied up a bit of our clutter so that it looks even better! We couldn\\\\u2019t be happier with our choice! Thank you! \\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"The Christina Baily Group was amazing! They helped us sell our house in a couple of months, where the previous realtor group couldn\\'t sell in 2 years! They also helped us to find the house of our dreams. I would highly recommend this group!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Rebecca was a pleasure to work with. Even though she is just getting started in real estate she handled everything professionally and like she has been in the field for years! From listing to staging to the final sale everything was a breeze. Throughout the sale she was there every step of the way and went above and beyond expectations. She secured a buyer just when we were about to give up. \\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Liz was unbelievably patient with me during my home search..She was always available morning noon or night to answer any and all concerns! I highly recommend Liz! What ever your looking for, Liz will deliver!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Liz was AWESOME! The part I like the most is that she has become a friend of ours after we bought the house. The whole process was fairly painless which I thought was shocking being that buying a house is such a huge event. I think it\\\\u2019s because Liz and the CB crew are just there for you and really guide you all the way through the process. Anyone considering buying a home in the area should contact Liz and the CB crew, I\\\\u2019m glad my wife and I did. You rock Liz!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"In today\\'s world everyone wants the one stop shop where you can get everything you need. So when it comes to Real Estate why not expect the same. Christina is a wealth of knowledge and the point of contact for everything from Lenders to Cleaners, Inspectors, Etc. If she doesn\\'t do it herself she knows the best person in town that does and for a reasonable rate. She not only managed selling our home for top dollar but then assisted us in buying a home outside of her typical area. She was willing to drive over 2 hrs. to show us homes and to represent us. She is truly dedicated to her craft. Rest assured when your in her hands that she will be there working for you. I look forward to working with her again when we are ready to find our retirement home. Thanks for everything CB\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Liz were amazing with all my questions and headaches because becoming a first time homeowner was not an easy task especially when your doing it on your own. Liz was there to guide me every step of the way even when I was wanting to quit a couple times through the process ?? Thanks for all your help and really appreciate everything you did for me to keep me sane. \\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Rob was great to deal with. We were going to wait to see the house we bought because it was in Red Lion and the others were around the Lewisberry area. Rob said \\\\\"don\\'t wait we\\'ll go down\\\\\" and he was right, there was already a bid on the house and we beat it, the rest is history. He won\\'t steer you wrong.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"I would strongly recommend Abbie. It was such a great pleasure working with her, was very informative on target and helpful. This is my second home and she made it so much fun. I can guarantee she will go the extra mile to help you and your family needs. Thanks so much for a great experience and helping us find our home. \\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"I was very satisfied with how things went in selling my property. Christina and Nicki provided very good communication, and were gracious enough to let me vent a few times; I realize that the problems we encountered were not your fault. Thanks for everything you did on my behalf\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Nicki was amazing!!! I have never had a realtor go above and beyond like she did. She was honest, knowledgeable, helpful, patient, understand and most of all she treated us like family, not clients. We love her! We recommend all of our friends/family to her. Thank you Nicki!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Nicki is absolutely THE BEST. Sadly our buying experience started off poorly. Then a friend of mine recommended Nicki. We thought hey why not we\\'ll give this one more go. We contacted her and told her what we were looking for and she truly heard us. She got back to us with homes that were exactly what we asked for! We called her about our favorite one right away! She went an hour out of her way on a Sunday night to show us the house!! Not many agents would do something like that. She was very friendly and sweet and made the buying process so easy. I highly recommend her. We love you Nicki! We are still so in love with our home! It\\'s everything we dreamed of.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"We love Nicki! She made finding the perfect home a delightful adventure. She really listened to our needs and dreams and she never grew impatient with us. We even invited Nicki to our house warming party so she could see the home she helped make possible. I would recommend her to anyone looking for their forever home and not just a house.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Nicki is amazing! She was patient with my husband and I and really listened to what we wanted in a house. Nicki was always very responsive and got back to us quickly. She is very flexible and willing to work her schedule around you and will work hard to get you into showings, even if it is last minute! I have recommended Nicki to multiple family members and friends and will definitely work with her in the future!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Nicki is simply the best! When we were going through our buying process, she was my go to gal. If you have any questions or concerns she is quick to answer or find an answer for you. I don\\'t know what I would have done without her!\\\\\"\"}\\n',\n",

That\\\\u2019s not how it should work in many consumers\\\\u2019 eyes.\\\\nThe best marketers, however, are successfully straddling that line with amazing critical and financial success. These marketing platforms aren\\\\u2019t sentient exactly, but \\\\u201cwicked smaht\\\\u201d as they say in Boston.

Nor do they want to hear from Alexa, \\\\u201cIt seems you\\\\u2019ve gained a few pounds. Should we cancel the recurring Doritos order?\\\\u201d It\\\\u2019s vaguely insulting to have complete understanding that you\\\\u2019re generating data breadcrumbs, virtually every second of the day between your phone, connected devices, cookies\\\\u2026and precious little of that data makes its way back to you in the form of better quality personalized experiences.\\\\nPeople aren\\\\u2019t feeling abused, oppressed or put upon in anything near the order of magnitude they are in the \\\\u2018real world.\\\\u2019 Not even close.

If you can\\\\u2019t treat them with respect, somebody else will.\\\\nWhat began as a wave of privacy concerns in the EU could be a tsunami of issues here if not handled deftly.

Brands that do this will find more inspired, informed, and loyal customers in return.\\\\nBrands that fail to invest in modern marketing architecture and maintain a \\\\u2018doggie door\\\\u2019 for data, where it comes in but never gets put back out in intelligent form, will suffer the inverse \\\\u2014 high churn, low satisfaction, and higher customer acquisition costs to futilely attempt to patch their leaky buckets.\\\\n1. Do you have the people to \\\\u2018play fast?\\\\u2019 Data is always being gathered.

The customer pays all our bills\\\\u2026.\\\\u201d yet the culture they\\\\u2019ve created is insular, territorial, and more concerned about their personal performance than the customer\\\\u2019s experience. If the customer is not at the center of your entire organization, you need to rethink structure.\\\\n3. Are your muscles too big? Muscle memory is a powerful thing. When people have had success doing things one way, they\\\\u2019re often times very challenged to do it differently. This is particularly true of high performers in my experience. If someone has used a meticulously crafted annual planning calendar to magnificent effect in the past, they may be unable to change to a more agile, just-in-time way of working \\\\u2014 even if they\\\\u2019re willing. Clayton Christensen has written very powerfully on this dynamic.\\\\nI don\\\\u2019t envision people taking to the streets to push back against superficially judgmental marketing. I do think people are feeling neglected, maybe even taken advantage of when it comes to marketing, however. With the proper tools and the right attitudes and aptitudes to use them, any business can prove it values its customers. It\\\\u2019s not an act of heroism.

The treatment then becomes more complicated and expensive because the problems have become extreme.\\\\nMy new patient described a terrible childhood experience in his dentist\\'s office when a cavity was filled without enough Novocain. This event kept him away from dentists for thirty years. To help relieve his fear of dentists, I gave him the following five tips to help overcome dental anxiety. Maybe they will help you, too.\\\\n1. First, appreciate the central role your mouth plays in every day life. So many of life\\'s pleasures involve the mouth, from eating and drinking, to laughing, talking and kissing. When we have discomfort in our mouths, every aspect of our lives is affected. And then, of course, there is appearance. A person\\'s smile is one of the first things people notice. Embarrassment from unsightly teeth can significantly lower self-confidence.\\\\n2. Know how much the dental profession has changed. New inventions have completely revolutionized modern dentistry. Amazing new materials and technologies allow today\\'s dentists to make your teeth look great, last longer, and function better than anyone could have imagined even a decade ago. And, dentists can work miracles on teeth quickly and quietly while the patient is completely comfortable. Some of the high-tech goodies available include: computer controlled Novocain, laser treatments, \\\\\"air abrasion\\\\\" to fill cavities without needles or drilling, the intra-oral camera so you can see for yourself how your teeth look, and ceiling TVs to distract you with videos while the dentist works.\\\\n3. Find a dentist who will give you the time and attention needed to calm your fears. The staff should add to the supportive atmosphere of the office by knowing your name when you arrive and being happy to see you.\\\\n4. Relate your fears to your dentist because verbalizing these concerns is the first step in overcoming them. It also enables the dental team to provide the specific attention you need.\\\\n5. Have your dentist clearly explain the procedure he plans to use to solve your dental problem. By understanding what is going to happen, your fears will be diminished. Your dentist will also help you avoid future problems by showing you how easy it is to take good acre of the teeth you have.\\\\nI am happy to relate that my new patient, the police officer, is now an old patient and an office favorite. His dental problem was cleared up, and his fear of dentists is finally gone. He comes in regularly to have his teeth cleaned and checked. I fully expect him to celebrate his 90th birthday by flashing a winning smile as he orders steak and corn on the cob for dinner.\"}\\n',\n",

OR, if that is not possible, to default clock in/out from the Kiosk to one specific customer/job.\\\\nFor example, in our business, we have unbillable time where employees show up to work, load up the trucks, have our morning meetings, etc... before clocking in to customers and heading out to job sites.\\\\nRight now, we are using a separate time-clock software for employees to \\\\\"clock in\\\\\" at the beginning/end of their shift but it would be nice if this feature was added to T-Sheets so when importing to quickbooks we wouldn\\'t have to be pulling from multiple sources for tracking time.\\\\nEven if they cannot clock in without selecting a customer, giving administrators the option to set clocking in to one specific customer/job would work as well.\\\\nFor example, we already have our company set up as a customer in Quickbooks and employees do \\\\\"clock in\\\\\" for certain maintenance tasks, if we could create a \\\\\"job\\\\\" under our company that represents unbillable \\\\\"mobilization\\\\\" then require that specific Kiosk to only allow employees to clock-in to \\\\\"Company > Mobilization\\\\\" it would work okay for us. That way at the end of the day, when our foreman leave the last property and clock their crews out, they can simply clock back into \\\\\"Mobilization\\\\\" as they head back to the shop where each crew member can then go to the Kiosk to clock themselves out for the day.\\\\nAllow service item selection prior to clock in using the kiosk mode, just like the phone app does. Currently, using the kiosk, the employee must select the job, clock in, then click the \\\\\"wait I\\'m not done\\\\\" button to go back and select the appropriate service item.

              " '{\"text\": \"200 years ago, 18-year-old Mary Shelley did an extraordinary thing. After a dreary winter evening spent indoors telling ghost stories during the storied \\\\u201cyear without a summer,\\\\u201d she took her idea and turned it into a novel. In January of 1818, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus appeared, first published anonymously in an edition of 500 copies, with a preface by her husband, poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Granted, Mary Shelley wasn\\\\u2019t an ordinary 18-year-old. In addition to her romance with Shelley and friendship with Lord Byron, she was also the daughter of philosophers William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Which is to say that she was steeped in Romantic poetry and Victorian thought from a very early age, and conversant with the intellectual controversies of the day.\\\\nNonetheless, the young novelist\\\\u2019s achievement\\\\u2014her synthesis of so many 19th-century anxieties into a monster story rivaled only, perhaps, by Bram Stoker\\\\u2019s Dracula\\\\u2014remains as impressive now as it was then. Shelley tells the legendary tale of the novel\\\\u2019s composition herself in an introduction to the heavily revised 1831 edition. In the animated video above, scholar Iseult Gillespie sketches out the book\\'s basics (as we know, Frankenstein is the name of the monster\\\\u2019s creator; the monster himself remains nameless), then briefly explains some of its \\\\u201cmultiple meanings.\\\\\"\\\\nWe may be conditioned by the genius of James Whale and Mel Brooks to think of the novel\\\\u2019s center as the doctor\\\\u2019s electrified laboratory, but \\\\u201cthe plot turns on a chilling chase\\\\u201d between monster and doctor, and what a chase it is. The book\\\\u2019s gripping action scenes get badly undersold in conceptions of Frankenstein (or the monster, rather) as a sad, stupid, lumbering beast. In fact, Frankenstein, says Gillespie, \\\\u201cis one of the first cautionary tales about artificial intelligence.\\\\u201d The novel\\\\u2019s Romantic interest in mythology (spelled out more directly by Percy two years later in his Prometheus Unbound) and its use of Gothic devices to evoke dread mark it as a complicated work, and its creature as a very complicated monster\\\\u2014a perpetually relevant symbol of the horrors unchecked scientific experimentation might unleash.\\\\nBut mostly Frankenstein comes to us as a novel about the \\\\u201cpower of radical ideas to expose darker areas of life.\\\\u201d Though it may do the novel a critical injustice to call it the Black Mirror (or Prometheus) of its time, the anxious contemporary anthology show is inseparable from a lineage of creative texts in horror and science fiction that owe a tremendous debt to the brilliance of the young Mary Shelley.

There was some non-relevant-to-this-post stuff at the end which is why it ends somewhat abruptly.\\\\nSo I looked the \\\\u2018photodashboard\\\\u2019 scripts earlier today. The first step is of course to run them and see whats going on.\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s a little insane for for 20 scripts. So I went digging.\\\\nThe first thing I did was remove the 404 that happens at each script. This was put in originally since there could be things like server.client.com/install_a and server.client.com/install_b and there was some bouncing to the right (or wrong!) place happening. If we\\\\u2019re running on a machine that has that in the future would just should include the install_whatever in the \\\\u2018base_url\\\\u2019 rather than try and build it using the \\\\u2018prefix\\\\u2019. I didn\\\\u2019t time the savings of it, but I would guess it would be around 2 minutes for the run.\\\\nNext I looked at the actual scripts and noticed something. It is extremely useful to include a specific setUp method in a class when having to do common setup tasks for the test methods (that is of course what it is for). What is less useful is when that setUp method does a login and then 50% of the tests immediately logout. If you find yourself in this situation, create a separate class \\\\u2014 one for navigating to a page with authentication, and one without. Which is what I did and got it down to 21 minutes. Yes, over 10 minutes saved by this simple thing.\\\\nThat is still to long. So I looked at being able to authenticate outside of the browser since that is slow since it involves a couple page loads. Using firebug I was able to see that the process of authenticating is just doing a POST with the username and password and when successful using the JSESSIONID cookie that is returned. With this I knew I could do this out of the browser and so have not modified the login_as method to include an optional browserless parameter. When this is set it will, outside of the browser, authenticate and then set the cookie on the se browser instance as if we had done it through the browser.\\\\nAnd with that we are down to 17 minutes. Which is still way too long, but that is the real speed of the app which means server.client.com is either massively underpowered or \\\\u2018application\\\\u2019 has some serious performance problems.\\\\nThis illustrates a bit of my process for cleaning up scripts.\\\\nSome important bits to glean from this that you can apply to your projects.\\\\nDeal with environment differences at the config level, not the script level. Scripts should be environment neutral.\\\\nIf you find yourself undoing something that was done in the setup phase of the script, it should be in a different class with a different setup.\\\\nInteresting approach. I like that idea.\\\\nwhich language are you working in?\\\\nI\\\\u2019d like to see an example in Python taking cookies from a urllib2|httplib|mechanize request and passing them to a WebDriver browser. I\\\\u2019ll whip it up myself, but if you have something handy it would make a great blog post of it\\\\u2019s own.\\\\nis what I\\\\u2019m doing for RC.\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"According to the results of 2016, the deposit portfolio of the Bank\\'s Credit Dnepr bank has grown by almost half a billion hryvnias, and today it amounts to UAH 3.8 billion. Only last month, taking into account the re-registration Ukrainians entrusted the bank with over 7.5 thousand deposits in the amount of almost 1 billion USD. Despite some subsidence of the deposit market last year in course of currency unrest or political instability, bankers in general point to an increase in the level of customer confidence in the banking system. This is noticeable not only in the growth of the deposit base of banks, but also in the prolongation of the terms of placement of funds, as well as in the fact that it is preferable to place term deposits with higher yields than demand deposits.\\\\n\\\\\"In early 2016, the main share of our deposit portfolio consisted of deposits for a period of 3-6 months. Today, more than half of the portfolio - 60% - is a deposit from 6 months to 1 year. Ukrainians are no longer afraid to make deposits with a fixed date of payment. Almost 100% of our deposit portfolio is term deposits with higher yields. We predict that such trends will continue this year, - says Andriy Moisjeenko, deputy chairman of the Bank\\'s Credit Dnepr Board. - Of course, it\\'s still too early to say that the deposit market has completely recovered. And in 2017, its growth will also be gradual under the condition of a calm socio-political situation in the country. It is worth to understand that our society is still quite responsive to any, even minor, shocks. This also applies to situational exchange rate volatility, and the purge of the banking market, which is still ongoing, etc. We were ready for these consequences of the greatest crisis in the history of Ukraine, and today it is very important to state that everything is the most difficult - behind. Already throughout the year, the market, despite the unrest that sometimes happens, continues to grow, and in the face of economic stabilization, these trends will intensify. \\\\\"\\\\nThe banker also noted that during 2017 deposit rates will decrease. And this, in turn, confirms the fact that the situation on the market is leveling out, financial institutions no longer need excessively expensive resources and are ready to focus on the activation of more affordable lending to the population and business.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Oct. 27, 2011 -- Eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia are more common among women than men. Binge eating, however, occurs at similar rates among both sexes. Yet men are rarely included in research studies on binge eating and its consequences and treatments, a study shows.\\\\nThe researchers analyzed data from 21,743 men and 24,608 women who participated in a health risk self- assessment. Binge eating in the past month was reported by 7.5% of men and 11.19% of women.\\\\nMany people feel ashamed and/or disgusted by their binge eating.\\\\nBoth male and female binge eaters face these risks as a result of their behavior.\\\\nJust because men are underrepresented in studies about binge eating does not mean the problem does not exist, says Ruth H. Striegel, PhD, a psychologist at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.\\\\n\\\\\"Efforts are needed to raise awareness of the clinical implications of binge eating for men so they can seek appropriate screening and treatment,\\\\\" Striegel says in a news release.\\\\nSusan Albers-Bowling, PsyD, agrees. She is a psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. \\\\\"This is a very important topic,\\\\\" she says. As a result of the lack of research, men and even doctors are not aware of the prevalence and symptoms of eating disorders in men.\\\\nThe stereotype of a man with an eating disorder is that of a wrestler who spends time losing weight before a match only to binge once wrestling season is over.\\\\n\\\\\"Sports can be triggers, but we need to think beyond the stereotypes,\\\\\" she says. \\\\\"It\\'s more than just athletes. Eating disorders in men are pervasive.\\\\\"\\\\nIt\\'s not just binge eating either. Men may also have anorexia and bulimia, she says. \\\\\"Sometimes they are being treated for depression, and the eating disorder is uncovered in therapy.\\\\\"\\\\nIn general, \\\\\"men tend to get less treatment than women for eating disorders, she says. But \\\\\"men do struggle with their eating and should not hesitate to seek treatment because eating disorders do affect their quality of life.\\\\\"\\\\nSo how can you tell if it\\'s an eating disorder? \\\\\"If it is affecting quality of life, relationships, or they are missing work, or it is causing other health issues such as weight gain or diabetes, it may be a sign that you need help,\\\\\" she says. \\\\\"There is help. You are not alone.\\\\\"\\\\nChristopher Clark is the executive director of the National Association for Males with Eating Disorders. Clark says that men with binge eating disorder may fly under the radar because it\\'s more culturally acceptable for men to overeat. As a result, they and others around them may think their eating habits are normal.\\\\nThis is why binge eating and other eating disorders often go undiagnosed among men. Doctors may not ask and men may not tell, Clark says.\\\\n\\\\\"Men should not be ashamed and should seek treatment because these are serious illnesses -- and could be fatal,\\\\\" Clark says. Clark\\'s group provides information, support, and resources for men with eating disorders.\\\\nSOURCES: Striegel, R.H.

Students should check with their graduate program adviser as to whether a copy is needed by the department as part of the requirements for graduation.\\\\nWhen a project is required, some record of the project, or the project itself, is filed in the academic unit and, in some cases, in the library.\\\\nA student\\\\u2019s thesis committee is composed of a minimum of three faculty members who supervise and approve the thesis. A qualified person who is not a regular Cal State University faculty member may serve as a visiting examiner and join in the approval of the thesis. This person serves as the fourth member of the committee.\\\\nVariations from procedures and regulations should be referred to the Office of Graduate Studies for review.\\\\nAll-university format guidelines are included in the dissertation and thesis manuals that have been developed to assist the student. An electronic version of the manuals, as well as templates, are available on the Office of Graduate Studies website. It is the student\\\\u2019s responsibility to make certain that the requirements are met. The student is strongly advised to become familiar with the instructions in the manuals. Copies from the library or departmental offices should not be used as examples of correct format.\\\\nThe academic unit, through the student\\\\u2019s adviser and/or committee, is responsible for the academic content and English usage in the dissertation, doctoral project or thesis and for the student\\\\u2019s correct use of forms of documentation and bibliography. In addition to the university format guidelines, each academic unit may select a supplementary style manual to be followed in matters of documentation and bibliography. Students should consult their graduate program adviser or committee chair concerning the style manual used.\\\\nIf the supplementary style manual presents regulations that conflict with the all-university format guidelines published in the university thesis manual, the university dissertation manual, or the university doctoral project manual, the university regulations take precedence.\\\\nSome graduate programs require style manuals or guides designed for journal articles. Although these are helpful for abbreviations, tables, figures and footnoting, as well as other purposes, students should be aware of the difference between a thesis and an article and make appropriate adaptations when formatting their thesis, approved by the graduate program adviser.\\\\nIf the academic unit does not recommend a specific style manual, the student should refer to the most recent edition of \\\\u201cA Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations\\\\u201d by Kate L. Turabian or \\\\u201cThe Chicago Manual of Style,\\\\u201d published by the University of Chicago.\\\\nThe student makes all necessary arrangements for preparing the dissertation, doctoral project or thesis for final approval. A list of independent word processing professionals is available in the Office of Graduate Studies.\\\\nAdequate time should be allowed for typing, reading and approval by the adviser, the committee members, and the university thesis/dissertation reader. Specific deadlines are listed each semester on the Office of Graduate Studies website. Ample time should be allowed for any special arrangements, such as duplication of the dissertation or thesis by the campus bookstore or elsewhere, prior to the deadline.\\\\nThe final version of the dissertation or thesis should be submitted to the student\\\\u2019s committee for final review and approval at least six weeks prior to the last day of classes. Deadlines for submission are available on the Graduate Studies website or in the Office of Graduate Studies.\\\\nFor summer completion, the student should check with the academic unit and the Office of Graduate Studies website for appropriate deadlines.

If there is a disagreement within the committee concerning the acceptability of the work, the approving signatures of a majority of the committee will be sufficient. Nonavailability of one member of the committee is not an adequate reason for acceptance of signatures by less than the full committee. No changes or additions will be allowed after the final signatures have been obtained.\\\\nUniversity Thesis/Dissertation Reader \\\\u2014 The dissertation, doctoral project or thesis is ready for review by the university reader after the faculty have signed off and the work has been produced in its final form. One copy of the dissertation, doctoral project or thesis sent via email to the Office of Graduate Studies for review by the reader for conformity to all-university format guidelines. The student should also submit a signed Verification Form and email a copy of the receipt generated by ProQuest upon account creation. The student will be notified of any revisions or corrections that need to be made. Final approval on format is given by the reader via email and ProQuest.\\\\nBinding and Microfilming \\\\u2014 Upon approval, ProQuest will create the bound copies and send one to the university library, and any additional copies to the student as requested. Once submitted and receipted, the work may not be withdrawn by the student from ProQuest. An agreement is completed for ProQuest to publish the abstract in University Microfilms International Journal; prepare a microfilm negative; and sell microfilm, photocopies and papers in electronic format to interested scholars. Arrangements for copyrighting also are possible through ProQuest.\\\\nNotification of Thesis/Dissertation Completion \\\\u2014 The grade for the dissertation, doctoral project or thesis is reported in the usual manner to the registrar by the appropriate faculty. The university reader notifies the Office of Graduate Studies that the approved thesis, dissertation or doctoral project has been deposited, the fees paid, and the agreement for microfilming and publication of the abstract completed by the student.\\\\nDepositing of Dissertation or Thesis in Library \\\\u2014 When the dissertation, doctoral project or thesis is returned by the bindery, the bound copy is sent by the university bookstore to the library for circulation. One set of the slides or separately mounted illustrative material is housed with the bound copy.\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"How close are we to printing replacement body parts?\\\\nThree-dimensional (3D) printing, the technology used to turn a three-dimensional digital design into an object by depositing material one layer at a time, has taken off in recent years. It now seems like almost anything can be 3D printed\\\\u2014shoes, airplane parts, houses\\\\u2014so why not print body parts too? It may sound like something out of science fiction, but to some extent, we\\\\u2019re already there. Doctors and researchers have successfully printed artificial implants for skulls, tracheal splints, and various bones, as well as prosthetic limbs.\\\\nBut when it comes to printing more complex body parts, we still have a way to go. Organs require specific cells to perform their functions and are more challenging to print. There are compelling reasons for working towards this goal\\\\u2014transplant lists are long and people are dying while they wait for a compatible donor. Not only would the ability to print organs help meet the demand, they could also be printed using the patients\\\\u2019 own cells, which would eliminate the possibility of organ rejection by the immune system. 3D bioprinting\\\\u2014printing with cells\\\\u2014is a relatively new field that aims to meet this challenge.\\\\nPrinting an organ is more complicated than just laying down the right cells in the right positions (which is, in itself, a challenge). Organs are made up of cells that interact with one another, grow, and change over time. Printing is only one step in creating an artificial organ\\\\u2014before printing, the correct cells (either the same type as the organ to be printed or stem cells) must be obtained and cultured, and after printing, the cells have to be grown into mature tissue.\\\\nCells are prepared in a \\\\u201cbioink\\\\u201d, made from a material that solidifies during or after printing, resulting in a 3D scaffold containing the cells. When an appropriate bioink is used, cells will grow, proliferate, and produce the proteins and biomolecules that make up the extracellular matrix that surrounds them in the body\\\\u2014meaning, in a sense, that they build their own home.\\\\nSo, if we can print functional tissue, why can\\\\u2019t we print an organ? In addition to the fact that organs are made up of many different types of tissue, which adds to the complexity, cells require nutrients, delivered through blood vessels, to survive and grow. Creating vascular networks throughout engineered tissue is an ongoing challenge. Researchers have developed many interesting methods to form these channels, like printing sacrificial materials that can be removed afterwards, but printing thick tissues is still a challenge.\\\\nResearchers are also exploring other exciting applications of 3D bioprinting. For example, 3D printed tissues can be used as improved models for drug development. Instead of studying the effect of drugs on human cells in a 2D plate, 3D models of these cells can more closely demonstrate how the drugs might behave in the body, potentially reducing the cost, time, and use of animals in developing drugs. Another step on the way to organ printing likely involves printing tissue that can interface with, and help to heal, damaged organs. For example, a University of Toronto research team led by Alex Guenther has developed a handheld 3D skin printer.\\\\nCanadian scientists have a history of success in the area of regenerative medicine, and Canada has a growing community of academic and industry researchers working in 3D bioprinting. Aspect Biosystems, a Canadian biotechnology company, has developed a tissue model of the lung that simulates an asthma attack in a dish\\\\u2014a 3D printed ring of airway muscle tissue visibly contracts and relaxes when exposed to histamine and asthma treatment drugs.\\\\nAspect Biosystems is also collaborating with Johnson & Johnson on a project to 3D print a replacement meniscus, the cartilage in the knee. Stephanie Willerth and her team at the University of Victoria are working on 3D printing neural tissue to study how the brain and spinal cord work, how to heal spinal injuries and neural diseases, and to develop models for improved drug testing.\\\\nWe still have a great deal of work to do before we can print replacement parts for people, but while we\\\\u2019re working on it, 3D bioprinting offers other exciting opportunities. Even if you never need a replacement part, your future healthcare will likely involve 3D bioprinting, as a tool for developing drugs, injury repair, or something else that hasn\\\\u2019t been thought of yet.\\\\nTechnology & Engineering 3D bioprinting, 3D printing, Alex Guenther, Aspect Biosystems, biotechnology, Erin Bedford, Johnson and Johnson, Stephanie Willerth, University of Toronto, University of Victoria. permalink.\\\\nSo you want to get paid for scicomm?\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"Diaper bags can easily become a black hole of stuff if we aren\\\\u2019t careful. These are three of my favorite tips to help you simplify and keep a mostly minimalist diaper bag!\\\\nFor years, my husband has called me his \\\\u201cfor just in case\\\\u201d girl. It\\\\u2019s his way of teasing me for always doing things \\\\u2018just in case.\\\\u2019 I\\\\u2019m notorious for planning and overplanning. I don\\\\u2019t like to be unprepared. Even as a child, I was a planner and a prepper\\\\u2013it\\\\u2019s in my nature. And let\\\\u2019s face it, since I had three kids in under four years, I\\\\u2019ve learned that our life is anything but predictable!\\\\nBut the downside of being a planner and prepper is that I can easily go overboard if I\\\\u2019m not careful. Especially when you have a tendency to worry like I do, it\\\\u2019s easy to want to be prepared for any possible situation. So when I was pregnant with my first child and began planning my diaper bag contents, I knew I would need to be intentional. But as a first time mom, it\\\\u2019s hard to know what items are really worth keeping in the diaper bag.\\\\nNow that I\\\\u2019ve had three kids and have been at this motherhood thing for a little bit longer, I\\\\u2019ve managed to cultivate a pretty minimalist diaper bag. I\\\\u2019ve especially tried to purposely maintain a simple diaper bag as my family has grown. I simply can\\\\u2019t physically tote around every possible thing each child might need.\\\\nThe following are three of my top suggestions for putting together a fairly minimalist diaper bag.\\\\n1. Don\\\\u2019t choose a huge diaper bag.\\\\nI realize this is a bit of a challenge, because the majority of diaper bags I see on the market are gigantic! They have a million compartments and could practically serve as a suitcase.\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s the problem, though. Larger bags inevitably tempt us to fill them with more stuff. Simply because there\\\\u2019s room, we\\\\u2019re more likely to actually fill each of the pockets and compartments with things we don\\\\u2019t really need. Even if you don\\\\u2019t start out this way, things will find their way into your bag over time.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s a lot easier to be selective with the contents of your bag if it\\\\u2019s smaller. Obviously, a small clutch-like bag is not going to cut it for the essentials, but finding a reasonably sized bag can be a big help.\\\\nMy diaper bag doubles as my purse when I\\\\u2019m out with the kids. I don\\\\u2019t carry a separate purse. So I need a bag that\\\\u2019s large enough to accommodate our needs, but not so large that I\\\\u2019m tempted to fill it with more stuff.\\\\nThere are plenty of diaper bags out there to choose from. For my first diaper bag, I used the Petunia Pickle Bottom Touring Tote bag. It was perfect for one baby\\\\u2013just enough room for the essentials. I used it for a couple of years and loved it.\\\\nOnce my second child was born, I transitioned to the slightly bigger Petunia Pickle Bottom Sashay Satchel bag, and I\\\\u2019ve used it for almost three years now. The size and compartments have been just enough for me with first two and now three kids.\\\\nThese bags are also well-made and durable (and super-cute!). I love the coated canvas which can be easily wiped clean. Yes, they are a little pricey, but they hold up well and have pretty good resale value. I was able to sell my first one for a decent amount of money and apply that toward my second one. Petunia Pickle Bottom also has periodic \\\\u201coutlet sales\\\\u201d where you can buy the bags at pretty steep discounts, which is how I bought my second one.\\\\nRegardless of what brand you use, try to find one that\\\\u2019s not huge.\\\\n2. Pack only the most commonly used/needed items.\\\\nThis will vary from person to person, and it may take a little bit of time before you figure out exactly what you need most often.\\\\nResist the urge to pack for every possible event or occurrence. I personally try to pack items that are either the most commonly used items or items that can serve more than one purpose. Some of these may not be absolutely necessary (such as toys or books), but they are things that we commonly use, so I include a few.\\\\n2 diapers (one for each of my boys)- For routine trips out and about, this is more than enough. If your baby is younger, you may want to keep more than one diaper in your bag. But in most cases, you shouldn\\\\u2019t need more than 2-4 diapers, especially if you follow tip number 3 below.\\\\nChanging pad- Many diaper bags come with one of these, but if not, there are many types of portable changing pads available.\\\\nHand sanitizer- With kids, this is a no-brainer!\\\\nMilk Snob nursing cover\\\\u2013 This is my absolute favorite nursing cover because it\\\\u2019s soft, stretchy and breathable, offers 360 coverage, and it doubles as an infant seat cover and shopping cart seat cover. I\\\\u2019ve also used it as a blanket for the kiddos. I also love that you can easily keep one arm out of the cover, which was extremely helpful since I have three kids and someone will inevitably need something while I\\\\u2019m nursing. Before I had this cover, I would keep a large muslin swaddle blanket folded up in my bag. I could tie two corners together to make a nursing cover, tie it to the handle of the infant seat to provide shade, and more. Choosing items that are multipurpose will go a long way in simplifying your diaper bag.\\\\n2 muslin burp cloths/bibs\\\\u2013 Once again, dual purpose items for the win. These double as both burp cloths and bibs, so I keep one for each boy in my bag. They\\\\u2019re really soft and absorbent, and they provide good coverage for messy eaters.\\\\nPacifier on a pacifier clip\\\\u2013 My youngest still uses a pacifier, so I keep an extra one attached to a paci clip at the ready.\\\\nOne neutral colored onesie\\\\u2013 At this point in time, my two boys wear a pretty similar size in clothing. So I keep one neutral colored onesie in my bag in case of a diaper blowout or other mishap, knowing that either boy could fit into it. In the past, when their sizes were significantly different, I kept two in the bag. I don\\\\u2019t keep full sets of clothes in my diaper bag, as I discuss below in tip number 3.\\\\nAn Itzy Ritzy Reusable Snack and Everything wet bag- This can be used to carry snacks, or it can be used as a small wet bag (in case a diaper leaks and you need to change your child\\\\u2019s clothes).\\\\n3-4 small toys or books- I like having simple board books, teething toys, etc. handy for the kids. These come in handy for for long wait times, such as at a restaurant, or while driving in the car.\\\\nKids sunglasses\\\\u2013 I keep these tucked into one of the bottle pockets of my bag.\\\\nA small miscellaneous bag- I use a small cosmetic bag to hold random items that I want to have with me for my own use\\\\u2013 acetaminophen, nail clippers, an extra pair of contact lenses, an extra hair tie, a couple of bandaids, etc.\\\\nA wristlet wallet- I mentioned that I don\\\\u2019t carry a separate purse when I\\\\u2019m out with my kids. I have a wristlet wallet from Fossil that is perfect\\\\u2013I just tuck it into my diaper bag. I love it because it can hold my cards and money, but also has room for my phone, lip balm, a pen, etc. Then, if I\\\\u2019m going anywhere without my kids, I just grab my wristlet out of my diaper bag and go. No transferring a bunch of random items from my diaper bag to a purse. Just grab and go. The exact one I have is no longer available, but you can find very similar ones here and here.\\\\nMy sunglasses, keys, and a pen.\\\\n3. Pack a second bag that stays in the car.\\\\nI started doing this once I had my second child, but I wish I\\\\u2019d done it sooner! In an effort to decrease the amount of stuff I carried with me regularly, I purchased a small tote bag to keep in the car with things that I might need occasionally, but don\\\\u2019t need all the time.\\\\nItems I keep in this bag include an extra set of clothes for each child, extra diapers and wipes, a couple of books, a larger Planet Wise wet bag (I have used this when a kid vomited all over his clothes, to hold wet swimsuits when we are leaving the pool, and so forth\\\\u2013it\\\\u2019s so handy!), and a simple first aid kit.\\\\nIf we are ever out and about and I need these items, we can simply go out to the car and get them. Since these are items that we don\\\\u2019t use on a regular basis, I really don\\\\u2019t need to keep them in my diaper bag at all times. Storing them separately in the car lightens my load but still keeps us prepared.\\\\nSimplifying how you pack your diaper bag can not only save your back and shoulders, but also give you confidence that you have what you need and that you can find it when you need it. Think about the essentials that you need on a pretty regular basis, and include those in your bag. Your list will probably be different than mine, and that\\\\u2019s fine! My list changes as my children grow and change.\\\\nThe point is to only keep the most common necessities in your bag and then keep a few extra items tucked away in your car. I think you\\\\u2019ll find you can get by with much less than what you\\\\u2019re already toting around!\\\\nWhat are some of your must-haves for your diaper bag?\\\\nJust discovered your site. Fantastic! Love it.\"}\\n',\n",

Witnesses are expected to tell a judge how Savio discussed and wrote about her fears that Peterson, a former Bolingbrook police sergeant, would kill her.\\\\nThe hearing, projected to last three weeks, is expected to provide the first detailed look at evidence prosecutors contend ties Peterson to Savio\\'s 2004 death. It stems from a state law that allows a judge to admit hearsay evidence in first-degree murder cases if prosecutors can prove a defendant killed a witness to prevent him or her from testifying.\\\\nIssam Karam, who said he worked with Savio at Parkway Imaging in Romeoville in late 2003, testified that Savio told him she had come home one night looking forward to a bath and glass of wine when Peterson threw her to the floor. Savio said the incident occurred after she had changed the locks to the home.\\\\nKaram said Peterson grabbed Savio\\'s throat and had a knife. Savio showed him a bruise on her arm, Karam said.\\\\n\\\\\"(Peterson) said nothing that she could do would make her safe,\\\\\" Karam said. \\\\\"She could not run or hide. He could kill her there and then.\\\\\"\\\\nAnother witness, Savio\\'s boss, testified that a number of times a Bolingbrook squad car was parked in front of her Romeoville business while Savio was inside. Lisa Mordente said that on one occasion, Savio was returning from lunch and approached another vehicle parked outside and spoke to a man inside.\\\\n\\\\\"She was very shaken up when she came back in, her hand was shaking, she had tears, she was a mess,\\\\\" Mordente said.\\\\nMordente also testified that Savio told her it was Peterson outside and they were fighting over money.\\\\nMordente\\'s testimony highlighted what is sure to be a key part of the trial \\\\u0097 the fact that Peterson was a police officer. His attorneys have raised questions about why witnesses didn\\'t notify police if they believed Savio feared Peterson.\\\\nMordente said she didn\\'t call police when she learned Savio died \\\\\"because it wouldn\\'t have helped.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"Kathleen had stated on several occasions she had called police,\\\\\" Mordente said.\\\\nDuring the hearing, prosecutors will present to Will County Judge Stephen White about 60 witnesses to testify about 15 hearsay statements. White will then decide if the jury can hear any or all of those statements when Peterson stands trial. Peterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering Savio, whose body was found in a dry tub. A trial date hasn\\'t been set.\\\\nThe Illinois Legislature passed the hearsay law after authorities named Peterson a suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy, then exhumed the body of Savio and reopened the investigation into her death.\\\\nWhile neither side has talked much about the evidence in the case, from the day Peterson was arrested, Will County State\\'s Attorney James Glasgow has made it clear that allowing Savio to tell jurors why Peterson wanted her dead is crucial to his case.\\\\n\\\\\"In essence, what you\\'re basically allowing the victim of a violent crime to do is testify from the grave,\\\\\" Glasgow, who pushed for passage of the bill, told reporters in May shortly after Peterson was arrested.\\\\nThe list of witnesses remains under seal, but Savio\\'s niece, Melissa Doman, said her mother, Anna Doman, is among those who have been called to testify.\\\\n\\\\\"It would be about things my Aunt Kitty (Savio) told my mom about how she was afraid for her life, she said she was afraid of Drew,\\\\\" Melissa Doman said, adding that she has not been called to testify.\\\\nAlso expected to testify are other members of Savio\\'s family, including her sister, Susan Savio. It was Susan Savio who told a coroner\\'s jury shortly after her sister\\'s death that Kathleen Savio had told family members that, \\\\\"if she would die, it may look like an accident, but it wasn\\'t.\\\\\"\\\\nThe death initially was ruled an accidental drowning \\\\u0097 until Stacy Peterson\\'s disappearance led officials to exhume Savio\\'s body, conduct another autopsy and conclude Savio was the victim of a homicide. Drew Peterson has not been charged in Stacy Peterson\\'s disappearance.\\\\nOther possible witnesses who could be asked to testify about the stormy relationship between Drew Peterson and Savio are his former colleagues. Eighteen times in two years, police were called to the couple\\'s Bolingbrook home to respond to reports of trouble between the two, with Savio telling officers that her husband had beaten her and threatened to kill her. Peterson was never charged. Savio was charged with domestic battery and later was acquitted.\\\\nThere also are court documents that prosecutors are expected to present into evidence, including a 2002 order of protection in which Savio alleges that Peterson knocked her down, ripped off her necklace and left marks on her body.\\\\n\\\\\"He wants me dead, and if he has to, he will burn the house down just to shut me up,\\\\\" she wrote.\\\\nAmong the more intriguing possible witnesses are members of the clergy at a Bolingbrook church attended by Stacy Peterson. In the days after her disappearance, there were media reports that she had told a clergyman a couple months earlier that Drew Peterson had confessed to her that he killed Savio and made it look like an accident.\\\\nPeterson\\'s attorneys have made it clear that they will attack the credibility of at least some of the witnesses.\\\\n\\\\\"All it is, is rumor, innuendo and gossip,\\\\\" defense attorney Joel Brodsky said after a recent hearing concerning information contained in the 15 statements. \\\\\"People had ulterior motives for saying what they said or are out-and-out unreliable people.\\\\\"\\\\nThe defense is not expected to call any witnesses of its own during the hearing.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"The industry is anticipated to almost triple in size in the coming years with the market expected to reach US $9.7 billion by the year 2022.\\\\nGlobal Ayurveda Summit in Kochi found that 77 percent of Indian households used them in 2017. This is up from 69 percent of households in 2015.\\\\nThe rise of ayurveda is being fuelled by growing emphasis on the importance of healthy lifestyles, suggested the report prepared by Powerwaterhouse Coopers (PwC) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).\\\\nThis is against the backdrop of India\\\\u2019s rising rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which the report credits with encouraging more and more people to look after their health.\\\\nTo this end, many Indians are turning to Ayurveda and other alternative medicine systems and treatments, such as unani, siddha, naturopathy, and homoeopathy.\\\\nSpeaking at the event, Governor of Kerala P Sathasivam welcomed the news. He spoke positively of the Centre \\\\u201c[giving] priority to mainstreaming indigenous medicine systems\\\\u201d in the 2017 National Health Policy.\\\\nHe credited this with giving \\\\u201ca policy boost\\\\u201d to \\\\u201cIndian medicine systems, such as Ayurveda.\\\\u201d The state was identified in the report as being well-positioned to lead the growth of ayurveda in the coming years.\\\\nTo build on the industry\\\\u2019s growth in India, PwC and the CII encouraged the use of technologyby the ayurvedic industry to satisfy demand. It also said that quality control standards need to be enforced if ayurveda is to be successfully launched at the international level.\\\\nThe Centre has been keen to promote traditional systems of medicine in recent years. It established the Union Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) in 2014.\\\\nThe Modi government has been keen to promote AYUSH both at home and abroad, constructing state-of-the-art homoeopathic laboratories and showcasing the industry at international conferences.\\\\nThis is fuelling growing uptake of AYUSH. Not only do 77 percent of households use Ayurveda, there has been a fifty percent increase in patients seeking homoeopathic treatment in the past five years.\\\\nAYUSH\\\\u2019s increased popularity is being observed not only among Indians, but also among international visitors. Some analysts have credited AYUSH with driving \\\\u2013 at least in part \\\\u2013 the rapid growth of India\\\\u2019s medical tourism industry.\\\\nThis is not to say that AYUSH treatments cannot be of some public health benefit. For example, homoeopathic treatments may lessen overreliance on antibiotics and other medicaments for ailments such as the common cold.\\\\nSome evidence has been produced, suggesting the merit of alternative approaches such as music therapy to mental healthcare, as well as the potential value of turmeric in the fights against arthritis and Alzheimer\\\\u2019s disease.\\\\nThere is a clear scientific consensus surrounding the limitations of what AYUSH can offer in terms of health. As such, the rising popularity of such treatments may seem baffling to some.\\\\nYet the industry\\\\u2019s continual growth on the backbone of near-incessant government promotion and largely positive coverage in the media does seem to indicate that, for the foreseeable future, AYUSH is here to stay.\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"BUCS Indoors made its first ever appearance in Wales, the huge competition\\'s 2011 edition being held at Cardiff University Sports Training Village. There were 410 starters this year despite all the venue problems that plagued this event.\\\\nEdinburgh won the 2011 senior team title with a grand total of 2289, only five short of the tournament record they set last year, to clinch this trophy for a remarkable ninth year in a row. Edinburgh shrugged off the relative disappointment of BUTC and were led home by a 581 from Erik Rowbotham and a 578 from Migle Petruskeviciute and support from Jenny Jeppsson 569 and former Imp Lizzie Bell 561. Nottingham won senior team silver for the second year in a row. George Harding got 585, Nicola Turner 566, Laura Bell 562 and James Carr 555 to leave Nottingham 21 points behind on 2268. Competition for bronze medals was very tight, but it was the light blues of Cambridge who pinched third place with 2241 with a very solid team performance from a quartet of Tak Ho 566, Heather Reynolds 564, Tim Craig 559 and Michael Mitchell 552. Cambridge were the last side other than Edinburgh to win this event, back in 2001 and 2002.\\\\nFourth place had to be settled on golds, with both Loughborough and Warwick having finished on 2235. In the end, the superior 10 count was Loughborough\\'s, fuelled by 574s apiece from Tom Cram and Mat Cole. Warwick\\'s leading duo were Jorge Lindley and Andrews Shreeves on 568 and 567. David Timmins top scored 571 for Oxford as the dark blues totalled 2231 in sixth place, bringing the number of BUTTS league clubs in the top six to a remarkable five. The next three places were held by SEAL clubs as London were seventh on 2213, Jamie Adams, a 3 time former individual winner here, got 577. Sam Bird got 582, powering Southampton over the 2200 barrier to 2204 and the last BUCS point. Just inside the top ten, Imperial held off Sheffield 2189 to 2187. Birmingham followed up their remarkable BUTC with a 2164 to place 11th, Reading rounding off the top dozen on 2146. As last year, there were no less than 36 complete recurve teams of four in the field, with nearly half of them going over 2100.\\\\nEdinburgh and Nottingham were well clear of the rest of the field in the Novice Team category as well, but once again, Edinburgh were on top. Edinburgh\\'s giant total of 1624 was shot by Douglas Jardine 554, Robbie Crick on 537 and Imola Cseke on 533. As with the seniors, second down to sixth were all BUTTS clubs. Nottingham\\'s silver medal winning novice team comprised Alex Naughton 539, Stylianos Hasjipanayi 523 and Darrel Watkins on 509. Birmingham grabbed bronze thanks to Tom Sherwood 516, Mickie Green 513 and Paul Griffin 504, pushing them to 1533, just three points clear of Loughborough, who bagged their second fourth placed team finish of the day, their top scorer Aadi Malkar on 524. Oxford finished ahead of Warwick 1523 to 1517, despite a 530 from Warwick\\'s Ben Pooley. Imperial were the last club to break 1500 on 1502 in seventh, whilst a 533 from James Towle left Southampton in eighth on 1491. The top ten was completed by Lancaster on 1475 and Bath on 1461. Bath\\'s Alexander Hickson notched 538 to keep his side two clear of Liverpool. Stuart Archer\\'s 527 gave twelth placed Sheffield a total of 1433. A total of 31 complete novice teams of three finished the day.\\\\nGeorge Harding (Nottingham) won his fourth individual BUCS title (& second at the Indoors) with a score of 585, keeping just ahead of his leading competitors. Sam Bird (Southampton) was second on 582, just one ahead of Erik Rowbotham (Edinburgh) on 581, winning his second consecutive bronze in this event. Remarkably, this is exactly the same top three in the same order as BUCS Outdoors 2010 - Bird\\'s silver is Southampton\\'s first individual medal at BUCS Indoors since 1987. Michael Judd (Essex) was fourth and claimed the final BUCS point available in this discipline with 579. Defending champion Jamie Adams (London) was fifth on 577 ahead of Tom Cram and Mat Cole, both with 574 (both Loughborough). Cram won sixth place and bragging rights for the bus home 38 golds to 36. David Timmins (Oxford) was the last gent over 570, with 571, whilst Jorge Lindley and Andrew Shreeves (both Warwick) were ninth and tenth on 568 and 567. Tak Ho (Cambridge) was eleventh on 566 just ahead of the group between 12th and 20th place all sandwiched between 564 and 557.\\\\nLadies recurve was won convincingly by Migle Petruskeviciute (Edinburgh) with 578 points, a senior individual gold medal this year, a step and a bit up from the novice individual silver she won twelve months previously. Second place went to Jenny Jeppsson (Edinburgh) who remains on \\\\\"\\'only\\\\\"\\' nine individual BUCS titles, including the last 5 BUCS Indoors. The next six ladies were compressed into a five point gap. Nicola Turner (Nottingham) emerged on top of this pack with 566 to claim bronze, whilst Ellie Dyson (Nottingham Trent) won the last remaining BUTC point on 565, one clear of Heather Reynolds (Cambridge). Laura Bell (Nottingham) scored 562 with 34 golds as against Monica Blanco (London) 562 with 30 golds. Lizzie Bell (Edinburgh) completed the leading rgroup in eighth place on 561. In ninth place was the only other woman to exceed 550, Magdalena Skowron (Aberystwyth) on 554, but only 59 hits - a ten instead of a miss would have put her fifth.\\\\nGents novice recurve was won comfortably by Douglas Jardine (Edinburgh) on 554, a full 14 points clear and narrowly missing out on the BUCS record. Positions 2 down to 5 were all a point apart, from 540 down to 537. Silver went to Ed Turner (Durham) with bronze to Alex Naughton (Nottingham). Just missing out on individual medals were Alexander Hickson (Bath) in fourth and Robbie Crick (Edinburgh) in fifth. A total of 22 gents novices broke through 500, whilst in the ladies novice category, it was only the three medal winners. Imola Cseke (Edinburgh) won by a full 20 points with 533, as Mickie Green (Birmingham) claimed silver on 513. Alex Lucas (Cambridge) was third lady novice on 501, twelve points behind second and twelve ahead of fourth.\\\\nTapani Kalmaru (UWI Cardiff) defended the gents compound title he won last year with a titanic 593 points to win by 6 from Alex Bridgman (also UWI Cardiff). Despite shooting only seven 9s, Kalmaru\\'s total is one short of the BUCS and All Unis record. David Wright (Northumbria) won bronze on 584, whilst Michael Bass (Lancaster) picked up the final BUCS point on 579. Both of the top two lady compounds broke the previous BUCS & All Unis record of 582. Hard lines then to Lucy O\\'Sullivan (Nottingham Trent) whose 583 was not enough to stop the title and records going to Naomi Jones (Edinburgh) with a formidable 585. Mary Perrott (Portsmouth) picked up third place with 576, whilst Hope Greenwood (Edinburgh) picked up a BUCS point, fourth with 561. Top novice compound was Richie Dunk (Edinburgh) on 558.\\\\nBarebow continued to grow in size this year, with the number of barebow starters up a whopping 62 - that\\'s in comparison to 21 longbows and 30 compounds. Andrew Buchan (Loughborough) finished top of the heap with 515, clear of James Annall (Bath) on 508. Jonathan Brownett (Aberystywth) pipped Chris Watters (Aberdeen) to bronze 497 plays 496, but Watters still picks up a BUCS point for his club. In ladies barebow, Annie White (Oxford) broke the BUCS record by two points with a score 509. White\\'s closest competitor was Amyce Smith-Bannister (Bath) who scored 497 for silver. Colette Bailey (Swansea) ensured a second senior medal would stay in Wales, third on 481, with Samantha Moss (Southampton Solent) fourth on 472. Top gent novice barebow was Tapiwa Chiwaridzo (Loughborough) who scored 489 to break the BUCS and All Unis record by nine - this record was set way back in 2002. Levi Schrama (Bangor) was second on 469 ahead of a 467 from Oskars Dzelme (MMU Cheshire). Claire Bailey (Keele) won novice ladies barebow with 340 ahead of Gwenan Evans and Milan Thomas (both Swansea) on 316 and 312 respectively.\\\\nChris White (Cambridge) won gents longbow, breaking the BUCS record in the process with a total of 442. Tom Goodwin (Loughborough) was second on 416, the top two over a point per arrow clear. James Maskery (Bangor) picked up bronze on 354. The top lady longbow was Holly Halford (Loughborough) on 283 - with only 4 starters, all the senior lady longbows guaranteed their clubs BUCS points. Top longbow novice by some distance was Metodi Salov (Essex) on 309.\\\\nIt\\'s customary at this point for the host club to be thanked, but of course, as everyone should be aware by now, there is currently no such thing as Cardiff University Archery Club - one wonders if hosting this competition will spark any local interest. Full details of what went on in the lead up to BUCS are detailed in the previous editorial article, so it only remains to thank in particular Steven Johnson, Ashleigh McCloud, James Cowie, Zoe Hawken and others for their performance in the week leading up to the competition and on the day itself, in ensuring the competition kept its head above water, despite all the difficulties. As it stands, BUCS Outdoors 2011 is currently without a host, so please get in touch with James Cowie or Ed Curran ASAP.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"In Ticket to Ride, you place train routes across North America in an attempt to connect particular cities which complete routes. How do they place these routes and how do they know which cities to connect you ask? Well, on your turn you are allowed one of three actions: 1) Draw Cards, 2) Place a Route, or 3) Draw Destination Tickets. When drawing cards, you are trying to get train cards of the same color that match the distance count of the route you want on the board. If the route is red and four spaces long, you need four red cards. Once you have those cards in your hand (remember, one action per turn), you place your train cars down and claim that route. You will also want to occasionally use your turn to draw destination cards. These cards tell you which routes to complete and give you an added score bonus at the end of the game for doing so. Setting aside some additional details, that is essentially the whole game.\\\\nAnd guess what? Ticket to Ride is a BLAST. I will be honest: the theme alone put me off from buying this game for a long time. I couldn\\\\u2019t imagine how a game about trains could be that enjoyable when compared to the highly imaginative choices you have with other games. The thing is, the theme is perfect for this game and I couldn\\\\u2019t imagine playing it any other way. Placing your little plastic train cars on the board to claim a route is oddly satisfying. You will feel anxious as you are hoping to get a route before one of the other players does. This is particularly the reason I recommend playing with at least three players. The game takes a little longer, but really adds tension to the game as route spaces are limited. If you have no available routes or have to try and take a path to far out of the way because other players have screwed you, you can be, well, screwed. At the end of the game, if you didn\\\\u2019t claim all of the routes on your route tickets, those points count AGAINST you.\\\\nThis game has a few shortcomings, mainly the mini cards that have been included with this version. They take up less space, but are a terror to handle and shuffle. These have been replaced with standard sized cards in other versions. The rest of the components are top notch.\\\\nBuy Ticket to Ride if you enjoy something light once in awhile or want to introduce other non-gamers to the hobby. It is also a great choice for younger children since the concepts are fairly easy to grasp, and what kid doesn\\\\u2019t like trains?

              " '{\"text\": \"I write as a resident of Kushi district, the site for the planned construction of a Futenma Replacement Facility (the projected Henoko base). Ever since it first surfaced I have been struggling against the plan for construction of a base that would foreclose the future of the children of the district. I am joint representative of the \\\\u201cAssociation of the 10 Districts North of Futami Who Do Not Want a Base\\\\u201d (formed by the residents of those 10 districts in October 1997) and General Secretary of the \\\\u201cAssociation of Women Supporting the Inamine City Government\\\\u201d (commonly known as \\\\u201cIinagu Association\\\\u201d) formed in April 2010. As an investigator for the project to compile Nago City\\\\u2019s History, I have been involved in an oral history project into the nature-rooted daily life and history and culture of this region, in particular of the Kushi district. I am also a member of the \\\\u201cNorthern Limits Dugong Investigation Team\\\\u201d and I participate in the Okinawa Citizen\\\\u2019s Biodiversity Network.\\\\nFor 17 years, without letup, I have been opposing the construction of a base at Henoko. The citizens of Nago, including the residents of my district, warding off all the pressures applied by the government, carried out a citizen referendum in December 1997 that plainly showed our resolve to say \\\\u201cNo\\\\u201d to the Base that had suddenly descended on our quiet backwater. Despite this, our district has been riven by \\\\u201ccarrot and stick\\\\u201d policies carried out by a government determined to foist the base upon us come what may, dividing parents and children, family members and relatives, and rupturing human relations that once were warm and close. In inverse proportion to the new facilities built with Ministry of Defense subsidy, local small-scale businesses lapsed into bankruptcy and Nago\\\\u2019s remoteness and backwardness deepened.\\\\nHowever, in 2010, realizing that base-related monies had neither enriched their lives or opened any future for the region, residents and citizens chose as mayor Inamine Susumu (a native of Mihara district) who pledged \\\\u201cnot to allow any base to be built, whether on land or on sea.\\\\u201d We take great pride in the Inamine city government for responding to the will of citizens and consistently opposing the base project, especially \\\\u201cfor the sake of the future of our children.\\\\u201d That is because we believe that what we adults must bequeath to our children and grandchildren is nature and peace. That is the responsibility of those who live today.\\\\nEven in the Districts north of Futami, on the part of residents whose lives had been torn apart by the base problem, a mood of unified resolve to promote our region was born. Steps in the direction of an independence that did not rely on base-related money earned the support of the city and eventually began to come on track so we could look to the future with great hope. We cannot help being consumed with anxiety that reclamation of the bay and construction of a base would bring these efforts to nought, dividing the region once again so that our days would be spent in a nightmare of anxiety.\\\\nIn our seafront tent, on days of blazing heat or with cold winds sometimes blowing, we have maintained, and continue to this day to maintain, our occupation, joined by people of good will from throughout Okinawa and Japan, and from all parts of the world, who have fought side by side with us against the unjust and violent imposition of environmental investigation by the Ministry of Defense. Despite from time to time feeling isolation and helplessness, driving off the despair that threatened to engulf us, our efforts bore fruit in keeping the flame of \\\\u201copposition to the base\\\\u201d alive and unextinguished. It is to the great happiness and hope of us local residents that an \\\\u201call-Okinawan\\\\u201d \\\\u201cNo\\\\u201d to base construction movement has been plainly established, which includes even the Okinawan prefectural association of the Liberal Democratic Party, the current ruling national party. Nevertheless, we find it hard to contain our deep anger that the government has ignored these developments, brushing them aide and proceeding by force to the point of requesting that the Governor authorize reclamation works, which is the final stage preparatory to construction. Such strong opposition (hostility) on the part of Okinawans is exemplified by Governor Nakaima saying \\\\u201cBase substitution outside Okinawa would be faster.\\\\u201d As a result, even after 17 years the government has not been able to hammer in a single exploratory peg. It remains fundamentally impossible to implement its plan to construct the base.\\\\nThe Governor, in his response to the environmental assessment on the Henoko Base construction project, declared clearly that it would be \\\\u201cimpossible to protect the livelihood environment and the natural environment.\\\\u201d It goes without saying that he should make a judgement of \\\\u201cnon-allowance\\\\u201d of the reclamation in response to the present request for reclamation based on the Environental Impact (EI) report, for the sake of the residents of the district, the livelihood of Okinawans and to protect the natural environment that is an Okinawan precious treasure to be handed onto future generations.\\\\nHowever, of late the Abe government has been desperately attempting to press ahead with the Henoko transfer, striving to shift the Governor by sending a succession of cabinet ministers on pilgrimage to Okinawa and making a great fuss over development policies, or by conducting secret meetings with Okinawan supporters of the transfer project. We cannot help feeling profound unease at such movements.\\\\nIn these circumstances, we appraise highly the Okinawan prefecture\\\\u2019s inquiry to the Nago City mayor inquiring of his opinion and Nago Ciy\\\\u2019s widely canvasing the opinions of citizens and people originating in the city in order to reflect them in his mayoral statement. This \\\\u201ccitizen perspective\\\\u201d is the true strength of the Inamine city government. Believing that the Nago mayor\\\\u2019s opinion will constitute strong backing for the Governor to decide on \\\\u201cnon-allowance of the reclamation\\\\u201d and so supporting it, below I set out my views on a number of points.\\\\nThe matter goes back to the idea of returning Futenma Airport (the \\\\u201cworld\\\\u2019s most dangerous base\\\\u201d) in order to reduce at least a little the burden deriving from the excessive weight of the bases on Okinawa. The Futenma base is one that was constructed illegally on village or agricultural lands whose residents had taken refuge at the time, which had been seized by the US forces who had landed in Okinawa in April 1945; it should be unconditionally returned. The notion of \\\\u201ctransfer [of Futenma] within Okinawa is extremely unjust and improper and amounts to increasing rather than diminishing the burden, and the fact that the chosen transfer site, Cape Henoko, is one that according to Okinawa\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cGuidelines for Environmental Protection\\\\u201d should be given the highest ranking as \\\\u201ccalling for the strictest environmental protection,\\\\u201d makes it even more unjust and improper.\\\\nMilitary analysts have already raised serious doubts about the deterrence value of the US Marine Corps and about Okinawa\\\\u2019s importance in geographic terms. Reinforcing military strength is out-dated, and the trend in international society is henceforth for the exercise of diplomatic strength by engaging in discussion, not for the construction of international relations through military force. Bases, and areas occupied by armies, are the most dangerous places, and it is the bitter lesson of the Battle of Okinawa from which survivors continue to suffer today that armies do not protect people, but cause great bloodshed. Those with experience of the Battle of Okinawa feel a growing sense of crisis that the construction of a new military base at Henoko might raise Asian tensions even higher and lead to a repeat of the catastrophe of war on these islands.\\\\nFurthermore, Okinawans know deep in their bones that base transfer within Okinawa would not \\\\u201clessen the burden\\\\u201d and that, when governments of Japan or the United States talk of \\\\u201cburden lessening\\\\u201d it is just so much words. When governments of Japan or the United States talk of their \\\\u201cmaximum concern for the natural realm and for the living environment\\\\u201d at the projected site they treat us residents of the area as stupid, since it is clear that both the natural environment and the human livelihood environment would be radically changed. I cannot contain my anger at this.\\\\nThe agreement between former Nago mayor Shimabukuro Yoshikazu and the national government on the construction of a \\\\u201cV\\\\u201d-shaped coastal design is taken to be a definitive mark of Nago acceptance. But he was elected mayor in 2006 on an \\\\u201copposition to a coastal design\\\\u201d pledge, so this is plainly a breach of that pledge. He betrayed the citizens of Nago. Such an agreement is counter to the wishes of the citizens of Nago. The will of the people of Nago was made clear in the citizen referendum of 1997 and, as many opinion polls have shown, that will remains unchanged today.\\\\nThe \\\\u201cReasons Why Reclamation is Necessary\\\\u201d or the reasons why base construction is necessary, are all bankrupt. What we citizens want is a base-free, peaceful, and nature-rich Okinawa.\\\\u201d There absolutely cannot be any \\\\u201cneed\\\\u201d for reclamation or for base construction.\\\\nThe natural environment is the basis for human life and we cannot live if it is destroyed. We who live today have no right to destroy the basis of livelihood for future generations.\\\\nThe experience of raising children, nurturing life with the fruits of the sea after the land had been devastated by war, sustained in those women and men two fundamental beliefs, the strong sense that the misery of the battlefield should never again be visited upon their children and grandchildren and a deep gratitude towards the sea, or nature. It is our responsibility to bequeath to future generations the richness of Cape Henoko that still brings colour to their cheeks as they speak of it, and its fruits. To permit its destruction would, I believe, constitute a crime against generations unborn.\\\\nWe adults must assure our children of an even better natural environment and livelihood environment and we must bear a responsibility for our children\\\\u2019s future. Reclamation would inevitably mean destruction of nature and an increase in noise, accidents, and incidents caused by US soldiers accompanying the \\\\u201cbase construction,\\\\u201d thus greatly changing the livelihood environment. The educational environment of children would also be damaged and it would become impossible for us adults to carry out our responsibility. Above all, I fear that construction of the new Henoko base will serve as an invitation to war and our children and grandchildren will again find themselves wandering on to the battlefield.\\\\nThe above paragraphs state my reasons why, in consideration of responsibility to generations yet unborn, we must not allow reclamation or base construction. \\\\u201cPeace\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cnature\\\\u201d are precisely the conditions for human beings to live healthily and must be passed on from generation to generation.\\\\nIt is no exaggeration to say that nature in Okinawa has suffered greatly from the Battle of Okinawa, from post-war base construction and from post-reversion, rampant development policies. The US military that occupied the islands after their reduction to scorched earth in the land fighting forcibly constructed the bases at point of \\\\u201cbayonet and bulldozer,\\\\u201d brooking no dissent and causing destruction of nature and environment. This is because, post-reversion and counter to the wishes of Okinawans, the bases were steadily reinforced and because a level of destruction of nature said to be even greater than that caused by the \\\\u201cstorm of iron\\\\u201d during the Battle of Okinawa was caused by excessive development under high-level subsidy and development policies adopted as compensation for having the bases.\\\\nIn this situation, because of its preservation of mountain, river, and sea interconnectedness, the Oura bay zone is an exceptionally important place. Seven rivers, including especially the Oura and the Teima, carry nutrients from the forests into Oura Bay. A continuous ecology links each system and its diverse life forms, from the river-mouth mangrove forests to the wetlands, sea grass and laver fields and coral reef.\\\\nFurthermore, the seaweed and laver fields, feeding grounds of the dugong, that extend through the Henoko coastal area and are said by researchers to be Okinawa Island\\\\u2019s largest and richest, are the core living zone of the endangered northern limit dugong. Based on such nature, our ancestors in this region built a lifestyle and culture. The oldest remains found to date in this district, the Umuibaru and Abe shell heap middens on Cape Henoko are estimated to date to between 2,200 and 800 years ago, the late Okinawa shell midden era. The Umuibaru remains are in a site that would be destroyed if the projected new base was to go ahead.\\\\nThere are many traditional shrine rites and rituals that have been preserved in this district from ancient times. I think this is related to the fact that nature remains. Traditional rites and rituals are deeply connected to mode of production and livelihood and include rites of thanks and invocations to the gods of sea and mountain \\\\u2013 to nature \\\\u2013 that sustain it.\\\\nIn this way, the nature and biodiversity of Henoko and Oura Bay has sustained the lives and livelihood and culture of the people living in the coastal region. Construction of a new base is completely unacceptable because it would destroy all of this.\\\\n(a) The Henoko dam vicinity is said to be the projected site for extraction of landfill for the reclamation, but according to the 2011 investigation of cultural properties in the Henoko dam vicinity carried out inside Camp Schwab base as part of the Nago City Education Committee\\\\u2019s detailed study of archaeological remains within the city, various remains were identified that were thought to be those of roads, stone walls and ditches probably built for drainage, reckoned to date from the Yatori settlement era.\\\\nThere may be cases when facilities or works are conducted for public welfare and regional development in which it is enough just to preserve the records of cultural properties, but US military bases are a completely different matter. They can only be considered a threat to local residents and harmful to the district. It would be extremely improper for important cultural properties left by our ancestors in this region to be lost for the sake of extracting landfill for reclamation to construct a base.\\\\nFurthermore, the ecology of the Henoko dam vicinity contains many wetland plant species that, within the Yambaru region, are to be seen only in Onna village and Nago City and, according to the Environmental Appraisal Investigation Committee of Okinawa Prefecture, a sense of crisis attaches to the endangered Nagabaarinotougusa [Haloragis micrantha] a grass so rare that it might be considered the \\\\u201cdugong of the land\\\\u201d (according to the Committee\\\\u2019s Yokota Masashi of Ryukyu University, it might already be extinct).\\\\nHenoko dam is also an important catchment area for local communities. Significant deleterious effects would be inevitable if landfill was taken from here. Nago City\\\\u2019s position is that it will not permit the use of city lands in the vicinity of Henoko dam, but landfill extraction should not be allowed even from privately owned lands.\\\\n(b) As for the extraction of landfill from the vicinity of Okinawa island, already various ill-effects such as shrinkage of beaches, erosion, changes in the configuration of lagoon bottoms, deterioration of ecology, have resulted from uncontrolled extraction. Local residents have a sense of crisis about this. Even if it were for the sake of industry I do not think that any further extraction should be allowed here, and the case is so much stronger when it concerns extraction for purposes of reclamation in order to construct a base.\\\\nIt is a matter of particular concern that the projected site for landfill extraction is on the dugong\\\\u2019s perambulatory route. The dugong is a very sensitive creature, which dislikes contact with human activity. Ever since the marine disturbance to do with the Bowling study carried out in 2004 in the Henoko vicinity, they have tended to keep away from it even though till then it had been their largest and best feeding grounds. It could be said that it was the forceful prosecution of its activities, including the environmental impact study, by the Defence Agency (now the Department of Defense) that drove the dugong away.\\\\nThere is a concern that the noise and disturbance to the marine environment caused by soil extraction and transport would disrupt their life and ecology and further worsen their living environment.\\\\n(c) Purchasing landfill is also very problematic. In order to avoid the EI process, the government referred to the use of purchased soil and sand, but in many districts the ill-effects on the environment caused by the extraction of soil and especially sand are problematic. Local residents are strongly opposed and, as is evident in the fact that the documents attached to the request for reclamation do not specify the site of extraction, it will not be easy to obtain. Even if they can secure it, the problem of introduced species contained in the introduced landfill, especially in that brought in from sites with an ecology completely different to sub-tropical Okinawa, would create a system disruptive crisis. It would also be in contravention of the Government of Japan (Department of the Environment)\\\\u2019s policies to seek registration of Okinawa as a World Natural Heritage site.\\\\nIn connection with purchase of landfill, it is also impossible to dismiss concern over nuclear waste pollution from the Fukushima nuclear plant accident. To the extent that questions such as the site for extraction, its ecology, the contents of its soil and sand, whether soil or sand from other sites might be included, are not made clear, what kind of investigation and checking has been done, whether it is possible to avoid introduced species and harmful substances, importation of soil and sand from foreign countries must not be permitted.\\\\nMany parts of the minutes of the March 11 Nago Fishing Cooperative\\\\u2019s special general meeting that consented to the reclamation of Cape Henoko [by a 94:2 vote] have been blackened out [in the documents publicly posted by Okinawa prefecture]. That is in breach of the spirit of the public notification and consultation process (kokuji juran)\\\\u3000designed to seek widest publication of information and, even if there had been a request for confidentiality from the Fishing Coop, it was not in accord with the public interest for that request to be met.\\\\nThere are quite a few members of the Nago Fishing Coop in our district and we know that especially those of the east coast have grave doubts about the base construction.1 The fact is that many of them worry as to whether they can continue making a living as fishermen and are tortured over the fact that they want to oppose but cannot go against the current in the organization. I would guess that very few of them gave their \\\\u201cconsent\\\\u201d positively.\\\\nThe Okinawan fishing industry has suffered greatly from the direct damage caused by red soil runoff pollution from the construction of bases during the US occupation period and from rampant development since reversion, and it suffers recurrent harm from incidents and accidents in the coastal zone provided to the US military. The serious problem henceforth is to reveal the process that is driving the Okinawan fishermen to the point of having reluctantly to accept compensation to go with reclamation and of taking back the sea so that fishermen can make a living as fishermen and can cultivate their successors. For that reason too, reclamation and base construction, that would deliver a major blow to the sea and fisheries, must be stopped.\\\\nRecommended citation: Urashima Etsuko, \\\\\"A Nago Citizen\\'s Opinion on the Henoko Marine Base Construction Project,\\\\\" The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol. 11, Issue 47, No. 2, November 25, 2013.\\\\nUrashima is a local Nago City writer and environmentalist, involved from the outset in 1997 in the movements opposing the construction of a new military complex in Henoko, On the occasion of the previous, 2010, election, the Asia-Pacific Journal also translated an Urashima article (\\\\u201cElecting a town mayor in Okinawa: Report from the Nago trenches,\\\\u201d 25 January 2010).

However, in feedforward inference, layer-by-layer processing can incur long delays, which would be intolerable for real-time applications such as millimeter wave antenna control for emerging 5G cellular systems.\\\\nWe observe that not all data items are equal in their recognition difficulties. In particular, some samples may be relatively easy, in the sense that a deep neural network can quickly classify them via early exit, thereby skipping all later layers to allow sped-up inference. This presentation will describe Dynamic Adaptation during Testing (DAT), a method that can exploit this observation, by automatically configuring early-exit criteria. By adapting to the given test set at hand, DAT can significantly shorten inference time without retraining the network. We have evaluated the DAT method by augmenting a well-studied network (ResNet). We demonstrate that DAT can automatically shorten inference latency for easy test samples by 7.4x and for hard samples by 2.8x, using the same pre-trained network. DAT is joint work with Harvard graduate students, Brad McDanel and Surat Teerapittayanon.\\\\nThis talk addresses several important technical issues in browsing heterogeneous unstructured multimedia feeds on consumer mobile devices derived from social network contents.

Dental implants have become the restoration of choice for replacing missing teeth. Implant retained dentures provide superior performance and usability.\\\\nImplant-retained dentures are far superior to conventional removable dentures. Chewing ability with complete conventional dentures about 15% compared to natural teeth. Implant-retained dentures function like natural teeth and provide up to 100% chewing function.\\\\nPatients have more choices with fixed and removable implant retained dentures.\\\\nFixed implant retained dentures require more implants than a removable implant retained denture because the denture is permanently affixed onto the implants and requires greater stabilization. Implant retained dentures feel much more natural than removable dentures and chewing efficiency is completely restored.\\\\nRemovable implant retained dentures require fewer implants; Four dental implants securely hold an upper denture allowing the size of the plate to be reduced or eliminated from the denture altogether. Plate reduction or elimination feels more natural and allows for the better tasting of food.

Depending on the patient\\\\u2019s condition, an immediate functioning temporary denture can be placed after surgery. A popular implant retained dentures option for patients in good dental health is the All-on-4\\\\u00ae dental implants procedure also known as Implants in a Day.\\\\nComfort - Many denture wearers experience discomfort at sometime. Gum tissues tend to shrink over time leaving the denture with a loose fit. A loose denture can cause gum irritation and mouth sores. Over the life of the denture, adjustments are needed due to gum and jawbone shrinkage. Denture wearers must use a messy dental adhesive to achieve the best fit. Upper dentures also diminish the taste of food because the palate is covered. Dental implants are permanent, natural looking and very functional. Implants have none of the negatives associated with conventional dentures and fully restore the biting and chewing force as natural teeth.\\\\nConfidence Level - Dentures tend to slip, and have an impact on the wearers\\' ability to speak and eat. Dental implants/implant retained dentures have no slippage. Properly placed, implants and implant retained dentures are stable and function like natural teeth.\\\\nCost - Dentures can be fabricated quickly. Dental implants can be a major investment both in their initial cost. However, the cost is offset in the quality of your life and dental health. Gums with conventional dentures shrink over time, requiring additional office visits for periodic adjustments and denture replacements. There is no gum or bone loss associated with implant retained dentures and there for no related maintenance costs.\\\\nDurability - Dentures are strong enough to last a lifetime. Because conventional dentures slip and do nothing to prevent gum mass shrinkage and bone loss, they require maintenance. Gum shrinkage often results in the need for a denture refitting or a replacement. Dental implants help preserve the patient\\'s gum and bone mass by preventing denture slippage. Implants and implant retained dentures are dependable and a permanent solution for replacing missing teeth.\\\\nCall Gentle Family Dentistry to learn more about implant dentures - make your appointment today!\"}\\n',\n",

If every member is actively participating then real change is inspired. That is what we need in education. We need each educator to go into their schools and cause a ripple. Even a small ripple makes such a lasting impact with a student, parent, educator, or administrator who in turns sends a ripple. I love that about social media. I believe PLNs inspire educators to cause ripples that are making a difference in a field that has been bombarded with bad policies and overrun by politicians who never were educators, do not have their own children in public schools, nor have spent enough time at at-risk schools trying to figure out why there\\\\u2019s such an enormous achievement gap that hasn\\\\u2019t closed for decades.\\\\nIronically, the original intent of the theory by Jacob Kounin was preventative. Kounin believed teachers should deal with negative behavior at the onset to prevent a ripple effect of this behavior. In a recent Skype conversation with Tom Whitby and Steve Anderson we discussed why lecturing is still heavily used in many schools and why many teachers cling to ineffective instructional methods. One aspect is that student teachers who are getting into the field are trained by those who use traditional methods. Tom Whitby will be discussing more of these topics in his new blog, which should be coming today! Tom discussed how getting new teachers the right type of mentors would encourage them to use effective instructional strategies.\\\\nConsidering this information, I want to make a long-term goal of causing positive ripples and preventing negative ripples. Everyday is an opportunity to stir the water, but are we actually making conscious efforts to do this? Do we really reflect on the consequences of all our actions before we make a move? I don\\\\u2019t, but this year I plan to reflect before I act.\\\\nChallenge: Teach your students about causing positive ripples in their community! Help them develop a PLN, start a club, volunteer, and so forth.\\\\nThis is goal 14 of this series! If you\\\\u2019d like to join the challenge, please visit the 30 Goals Facebook group!\\\\nWhat are your thoughts? How can we cause and prevent ripples?\\\\nAnother teacher and I will be taking this on in the next few weeks, as we seek to engage students more completely in the events of the world. Perhaps a way of connecting them to the concept of creating a ripple is to view the film \\\\u201cPay It Forward\\\\u201d- a related concept that, again, involves students in taking positive action in their world on a local level to see global change.\\\\nI love that film! It is very inspiring! I was thinking about that movie as well as an afterthought when posting this.\\\\nThank you so much for writing this response Shelly! It disproves the question in my title when you and many others have generated and engaged in conversations about the topic.\\\\nI think that mentoring is the most important part of a new teacher\\\\u2019s development. I have learned from failing and trying new things, but those are both very individualistic acts. I would not be where I am now if it weren\\\\u2019t for the mentors that I have searched for and connected with.\\\\nI think it was a valid question you asked on your blog. Your wonderful and brave post started an important discussion. Moreover, it caused many of us to reflect on how we use social media.\\\\nNice analogy. I think so often I want to create BIG waves. I long for the change to happen quickly and right now. I need to be better about being purposeful in my ripples. It may not happen all at once or in as big of a way as I would hope. But I need to remember that I am not the only one stirring up the water. I have a wonderful PLN who is doing their part to make ripples as well.

              " '{\"text\": \"Andy and I had heard many good things about Austin, we had wanted to visit for quite some time but flights were always expensive. One day I did a search for tickets to Austin on upcoming weekends. I found round trip flights from Chicago to Austin for $225, before the fares went away I purchased our tickets.\\\\nWe had a rental car which made it easy to visit a few of the wineries in Texas hill country. There are quite a few wineries in the area and most of the wine that we tasted was really good.\\\\nThere are guided tours of the Capitol buildings available but we decided to just walk around the premises outdoors on our own schedule.\\\\nAustin has many murals all over town. We walked/drove around to look at them and snap a few pictures. Some are more artistic than others, but it was fun to see this street art all over the town.\\\\nOur favorite area of Austin was South Congress street. There are a ton of unique shops, bars and restaurants in the area. We spent quite a bit of time in this area, eating a few meals and enjoying drinks on several different patios.\\\\nIt wouldn\\\\u2019t be a visit to Austin without getting drinks on Sixth Street. We got recommendations of which bars to check out and grabbed a few Lone Star beers. While there were a decent number of college kids that were out, there were also a lot of young professionals.\\\\nWhenever we look back to food we have had on vacation, we hands down agree that Austin is our favorite. We were lucky enough that I have a few friends who live/have lived in Austin and gave us their recommendations which were all amazing.\\\\nWe had heard that Rudy\\\\u2019s was a dive but when we first pulled up we thought that our address was wrong \\\\u2013 it was a gas station with a BBQ restaurant inside.\\\\nWe waited in line and when it was our turn to order the cashier asked if it was our first time at Rudy\\\\u2019s. When we said it was they gave us a sampling of the different meats so we could better decide what we wanted to order. I was surprised that my favorites were the turkey and the sausage as I usually order pulled chicken or pulled pork at BBQ restaurants.\\\\nWe placed our order and the food was placed on a paper lined cafeteria tray. We sat at the communal tables and used the rolls of paper towels on the table as our napkins. Once we finished up, we washed our hands at the large sinks located in the dining room.\\\\nRudy\\\\u2019s is certainly not a fancy restaurant by any means but it was delicious! We visited another location when we were in Dallas for a wedding but it was not nearly as good as the BBQ that we had when we were in Austin.\\\\nThe Salt Lick is a BBQ institution in Austin and is located about a 20 minute drive from downtown. For those without a car that want to experience the food, there is also a location in the Austin airport.\\\\nWe were told by our friends who live in Austin to expect a long wait. We waited around 45 minutes to get our table which wasn\\\\u2019t too bad. To help pass the time there was some live music which was entertaining. The restaurant is BYOB so it was fun to see people who had coolers full of beer waiting for their tables. While we BYOB in Chicago, this took the concept to a completely different level.\\\\nSimilar to Rudy\\\\u2019s when our waiter heard it was our first time, we got a meat sampler platter. Compared to Rudy\\\\u2019s I would say that the BBQ was tied. The ambiance in the 2 restaurants were quite different, but for us, we would choose Rudy\\\\u2019s as we got in and out easily.\\\\nOne of the things that we knew we for sure wanted to have was authentic TexMex food. There were several recommendations that we got but decided to go to El Chile.\\\\nI typically rate a Mexican restaurant on the chips and salsa. You can really tell how much pride a restaurant takes in their cooking and can easily tell when their chips and salsa are from scratch. Both the chips and salsa at El Chile were unbelievable! The chips were thin with just the right amount of salt on them and the salsa was very unique but just the right amount of heat. It was so good in fact that I got 2 jars of it to take home.\\\\nWe joined Andy\\\\u2019s college friend and his fiance at dinner. Andy and his friend caught up and we all enjoyed the delicious margaritas and Mexican food.\\\\nWe went to Magnolia Cafe, a 24 hour cafe to have breakfast one morning. It is located on South Congress, our favorite street in Austin which has many cool shops, bars and restaurants. We arrived just in time as there was a short wait when we arrived which grew into a long wait after we were seated.\\\\nWe decided to split a breakfast entree and ordered a side of gingerbread pancakes, both of which were delicious. The portions were massive! We were hungry but it was impossible to finish it all.\\\\nI love breakfast tacos, especially ones with beans in them, and they are very easy to come by in Austin. We grabbed fast, inexpensive tacos for breakfast at Torchy\\\\u2019s Tacos which were really, really good.\\\\nAustin is a very popular city and hotels are are really expensive on the weekends. Our initial search for hotels in the downtown area were coming up at $170-$250 a night. We certainly didn\\\\u2019t want to pay that, but also didn\\\\u2019t want to stay far from downtown. I was out of options when Andy jumped in with a great suggestion. He has a friend who works at Hilton and was able to extend the family and friends rate for us.\\\\nWe booked the DoubleTree Austin University as it was the least expensive Hilton hotel that we could stay at that was still in a relatively good location. Friends that were familiar with the area told us that we didn\\\\u2019t want to stay east of the highway. We figured since our hotel was right on the highway and next to the University of Texas campus that it would be fine.\\\\nOnce we checked in we headed to our room which was really nice, much nicer than hotels that we typically stay at. My favorite benefit of staying at the DoubleTree though is the free cookie that you receive when you check in. Both of us love sweets so a free warm cookie would never be denied.\\\\nThe hotel is a decent walk from the sights and sounds of town, but living in Chicago we are used to doing lots of walking. Visiting in February, the weather was a little cool but nice and getting around on foot was very easy.\\\\nWhen we were driving back from dinner one night, we saw what our friends had warned us about when we mentioned the hotel location. Just a few blocks from our hotel there were police arresting a few guys and swarms of people flooded the street. While we didn\\\\u2019t feel unsafe, had we been on foot instead of in our car, I think we would have felt very different.\\\\nWe had an amazing time during our long weekend in Austin. We were able to do a bunch of fun things and ate some of the best food we have had on any vacation.\\\\nWe expected to absolutely love Austin, while we did enjoy it, we weren\\\\u2019t dying to move there when we left. There were very cool parts of town like South Congress but besides these bubbles, the city felt very suburban.\\\\nIf we were to do it over, we would visit a little later in the year when it was warmer. While the weather was great in February compared to Chicago, it was cool enough to require a jacket at times.\"}\\n',\n",

The best word to use when it comes to the roller coaster of feelings and competencies when it comes to having Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).\\\\nI just spent a week of feeling really stable and present in my life. This is a big deal for someone with DID because this is not the norm. I have learned a lot of skills recently that have enabled me to feel more present and grounded in my body and in my life.\\\\nUsually, I feel like I have one foot in this world, and the other in a world of pain and suffering that comes from my severe childhood abuse history.\\\\nWhen I operate in my norm of being in both worlds at the same time, I am not connected to my present day life in any significant way. I may be present enough to speak to people in present day, but I am not present enough to enjoy and experience present day life.\\\\nThis disconnection from present day enables the suicidal and isolation thoughts and feelings to take over out of nowhere.\\\\nYesterday, I woke up feeling good, and even acknowledged to myself how awesome it was that I haven\\\\u2019t been experiencing any suicidal thoughts and have been really present and active in my children\\\\u2019s lives. Life was good.\\\\nThat is, until I went to therapy. In therapy, I have the opportunity to be my true authentic self. Authentic for me is to acknowledge that I have a lot of parts inside me who experience the world differently, and carry lots of emotions that I don\\\\u2019t experience. It makes for a complex way of living.\\\\nWithin 5 minutes of being in the therapy room, I could feel my healthy, happy self crumbling and slipping away. My underlying feelings from myself and the many parts I share this body with were bubbling up.\\\\nSometimes these crappy feelings pass once I leave therapy, but not this time. This time they hung around all day.\\\\nUnfortunately, it makes a big difference because my other parts often come up with ideas like rational reasons for why we should commit suicide. Sometimes I am literally listening to these thoughts and think they are mine, and start planning suicide. Fortunately, I usually catch myself before anything serious happens. But it is also terribly scary when I realize I can be confused enough to not be able to separate out my thoughts and those of troubled parts of me.\\\\nWhen I was in my 20s, I was having a rather ordinary day from an emotional standpoint\\\\u2014not upset about anything. I can remember this day as if it was yesterday because it was one of the first times I can remember watching myself when someone else was in control of our shared body. This other part quietly drove us to our home, and proceeded to take a significant overdose of pills, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. After some time passed the pills were working and I was able to call someone for help.\\\\nI almost died. I didn\\\\u2019t have any intention in doing that, but it happened. To this day, I still don\\\\u2019t even know why it happened. But, it got my attention as to what could happen if I wasn\\\\u2019t paying close attention to my experience in this body. More hyper vigilance.\\\\nWe have not attempted suicide since that time, but my \\\\u201cothers\\\\u201d inside have become more creative in trying to achieve the goal of suicide. Their technique today is to make it confusing as to whether it is my thoughts or theirs.\\\\nIt is as if someone has put in a floppy disc to run someone else\\\\u2019s programmed thoughts in my brain. I don\\\\u2019t know if you can imagine how scary that might feel.\\\\nSo, the roller coaster of being DID and its challenges are the theme of this week. Looking forward to an easier time.\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Humans are social beings and need to be with others and form relationships but our relationship behaviors do not \\\\\"come naturally\\\\\" and they need to be learned similar to other social skills (Schneider, Gruman & Coutts, 2005, p.77). Many psychologists argue that the kind of relationships infants have with their primary caregivers is the blueprint for the later life relationships (Schneider, Gruman & Coutts, 2005). Behaviors in adult relationships\\' are influenced by the kinds of relationships and attachments they have experienced in their early years with their primary caregivers. This is the basic perspective of the theory of attachment styles that claims that the kind of bonds we form early in life influence the kinds of relationships we form as adults (Aronson, Wilson, & Akert, 2011). After observing interactions of infants with their mothers the developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth and her colleagues (1978) identified three patterns of attachments that include the secure attachment style, anxious/ambivalent attachment style and avoidance attachment style (Schneider, Gruman & Coutts, 2005). Depending on the specific attachment style one was exposed to and learned as an infant will demonstrate specific adult attachment styles which involve the secure, preoccupied, fearful and dismissing adult attachment styles (Schneider, Gruman & Coutts, 2005, p.85). Therefore one can see that the interactions we first have with our primary caregivers could shape our relationships as adults. Additionally no one can doubt that children are first shaped inside their families and no one can underestimate the importance of the parents\\' role on a child\\'s development and how it can affect their future development. This brings to mind the theory of parenting styles I learned in a previous psychology class. Diana Baumrind developed a theory of four distinct parenting styles which reflect the two dimensions of parenting which are responsiveness and demandingness (Arnett, 2010). Responsiveness reflects the degree to which parents are supportive and sensitive to the child\\'s needs and reflects the amount of love, warmth and affection expressed to their children (Arnett, 2010). Demandingness reflects the degree to which parents are demanding, have rules and high expectations for their children and it reflects the amount of controlling and monitoring parents have towards their children (Arnett, 2010). Based on these two dimensions the four types of parenting styles are authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and neglectful or disengaged. Parenting style has been found to greatly influence and affect adolescent development and also could probably affect the relationships with others in a similar fashion that attachment style may.\\\\nAs stated above early attachment is influential on one\\'s life and children\\'s attachment styles develop from a combination of biological influences and social learning (Schneider, Gruman & Coutts, 2005). The primary caregiver\\'s behavior and interaction towards an infant could affect and shape their expectations and interactions with others throughout their lives. Regarding Ainsworth\\'s attachment styles infants with secure attachment styles show trust to their caregivers, do not worry when being abandoned and view themselves as worthy and well liked (Aronson, Wilson, & Akert, 2011). They use their primary caregiver as a \\\\\"secure base from which to explore\\\\\" when all is well and use them for consolidation when frightened (Arnett, 2010, p.189). Infants with anxious/ambivalent attachment styles are insecure and anxious because they are not able to predict their caregiver\\'s behavior since their caregivers demonstrate inconsistent behavior and affection (Aronson, Wilson, & Akert, 2011). Infants with avoidance attachment styles demonstrate suppressive feelings towards their caregiver and are discouraged from creating an intimate relationship with them as due to their distanced behavior have caused them to worry about rejection (Aronson, Wilson, & Akert, 2011).\\\\nDepending of the attachment style that infants and young children have been exposed to they develop specific patterns of relationships that affect their responses to their adult relationship s. For instance a child that had a secure attachment with their caregivers would be able to develop lasting relationships as adults. Contrary a child who had an avoidant attachment with their caregivers would have difficulty creating long lasting relationships and would have difficulty to trust others. Research has been able to confirm that our adult relationships are shaped by our early patterns of attachment and with the ways of dealing with closeness, separation and love (Schneider, Gruman & Coutts, 2005). Furthermore Bartholomew (1990) identified four styles of adult attachment that are derived from the two dimensions that have to do with our self image and image of others (Schneider, Gruman & Coutts, 2005; Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991). For the dimension of self image and image of others there are two levels which are the positive and negative and the combination of them composing the four patterns of adult attachment styles. Additionally this model, as indicated in the figure, includes the dimensions of dependency on the horizontal axis and avoidance on the vertical axis and both vary from low to high (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Ma, 2006). For instance the secure adult attachment style based on this model is characterized by positive self image with low dependency and by a positive image of others with low avoidance. Therefore one who has secure attachments will be comfortable with intimacy and autonomy (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991).\\\\nFrom personal experience and from people I know I believe that attachment theory, and the above mentioned model, could accurately be applied to explain relationship patterns. Personally as a child I developed a secure attachment with my parents as they were responsive to my needs and caring, they were there when I needed them and they provided me with reassurance to explore my environment. As an adult I have been able to develop lasting relationships and I am comfortable with closeness, trusting others, and interdependence. When considering others from my close environment I also can relate their relationship patterns with the attachment theory and this appears helpful to better understand them. For instance a close friend of mine and previous colleague seems she has developed a preoccupied attachment style and this could explain her pattern of relationships thus far in her life. She has an anxious/ambivalent attachment style with her parents as a result of their job obligations, and their personalities were inconsistent regarding their affection towards her. As an adult she developed a preoccupied attachment style and she exhibits this attachment style towards both her friendships and intimate relationships. Particularly when it comes to her intimate relationships this type of attachment style is possibly responsible for her two divorces within a five year time frame and her being less satisfied with her romantic relationships. Whenever she entered into a romantic relationship she acted obsessive and was very preoccupied with her relationship. Most of her relationships were short-lived and even when she ended up getting married her first marriage lasted only one year and her second just a little longer. The main reason for this, based on what I learned from the attachment theory, seems to be the fact that she entered her relationships quite fast without first really knowing her partner and by being obsessive, anxious, jealous over her relationship it probably discouraged her intimate others and scared them away. Fortunately people are able to change and as one learns one\\'s attachment style they could possibly unlearn it over time (Schneider, Gruman & Coutts, 2005). However in order to do so one needs to become aware of their relationship pattern and then decide what actually needs to be accomplished in order succeed this (Schneider, Gruman & Coutts, 2005).\\\\nAs people are exposed to different attachment styles from very young ages they also are exposed to different parenting styles, and as already mentioned Dania Baumrind developed a theory of four distinctive parenting styles. One of them is the authoritarian parenting style characterized by parents who are high in demandingness and low in responsiveness (Arnett, 2010). Authoritarian parents are strict and have high expectations from their children, have set rules and expect obedience without questioning and without really explaining their reasoning to their children (Berger, 2005). They are obedience and status oriented and expecting their orders to be obeyed without explanation (Darling, 2011). A child that grows up in a family environment where they do not have the opportunity to communicate, and constantly feel they have to act in a certain way, will have serious problems in many aspects of their development. They will grow up with low self-esteem, might be depressed, anxious and frustrated and they lag behind in social skills and social adaptability (Berger, 2005; Arnett, 2010). Another parenting style is the authoritative style characterized by high demandingness and high responsiveness (Arnett, 2010). Contrary to the previous style parents set rules and expectations but are open to discussion and negotiation as the parents are willing to listen to their children and guide them when questions arise (Arnett, 2010). Authoritative parents always maintain the power to say \\\\\"no\\\\\" but also they want their children to be assertive, socially responsible, self-regulated and cooperative (Darling, 2011). A child who grows up in a family where the parents utilize this style are more likely to grow up independent, have self-control, have more developed social skills, able to communicate and make friendships, have healthy relationships and emotional attachments (Arnett, 2010). From growing in a balanced environment they are less likely to have psychological problems and they become balance adults by themselves.\\\\nThe next two parenting styles are the permissive and the neglectful, or disengage style. Permissive parents are not demanding, they hardly ever punish their children and do not have a lot of control of their children as they usually let them do whatever they want (Arnett, 2010). They seem to want to be more like their children\\'s friends instead of their parents. Children growing up in a permissive family will be more likely to have higher self esteem, but they will have poor emotional regulation, are immature and irresponsible (Arnett, 2010). They may show some developed social skills but actually do not posses them as they have been used to always getting what they want. The inadequate emotional regulation appears to be a problem for friendship formation (Berger, 2005). The disengaged or neglectful parenting style is characterized by parents who do not care about their children. These parents are low in both demandingness and responsiveness and they may seem little emotionally attached with their children (Arnett, 2010). Children growing up with this parenting style are exposed to an indifferent environment, without any guidance or support and are most likely to be depressed, impulsive and have poor social skills (Arnett, 2010). In general this type of parenting is associated with negative outcomes in a child\\'s development in all domains of their life.\\\\nThese descriptions of the various parenting styles are fairly general and brief. There are also parents between styles or one parent may be of one style and the other of another style. However one can see that each child\\'s development is affected by the parenting style of their parents and this could also affect their relationships with others as well. The parenting style a parent follows is influenced by various reasons such as personality type, psychological states, a child\\'s behavior, education, socioeconomic status and much more (Arnett, 2010). Comparing the different attachment styles discussed previously with the different parenting styles I believe that it is possible for both to affect people\\'s patterns of relationships as both could shape the development of a child. Considering the importance and significance of situational and social influences one can see that the initial social context of children is their families and their family environment is able to shape their development and influence the development of their personal and social relationships.\\\\nArnett J.J.

              " '{\"text\": \"Practicing meditation, such as breath awareness, body scan, walking meditation, mindful dishwashing, etc. can support us in becoming more mindful in our everyday lives, including our parenting. Through meditation practice, we can learn to be more present in general and with our children --and more intentional in our interactions with them. In addition to meditation practice as a way to support the cultivation of mindful parenting, the following are ideas of ways to approach parenting as a mindfulness practice in and of itself... to support us to be more present in our parenting and to enhance our connection with our children.\\\\nChoose a daily interaction that you have with your child \\\\u2013 brushing their teeth, breastfeeding, walking to school, bedtime stories, etc. Set an intention to be fully present in this interaction for a certain time frame, eg \\\\u2013 a week. You can do this by bringing your awareness, as best you can, fully to your interaction with your child and being fully immersed in the activity with them. When your mind starts to wander to other things like work, planning for dinner or the weekend, to-do lists, etc., see if you can just let those thoughts be; then come back to being present with your child. Remind yourself that you have the rest of the day to think about these issues, but only this moment with your child.\\\\nThese interactions are commonly approached as tasks that need to be completed so that we can \\'get on with the rest of our day or evening.\\' And yet it is the constellation of \\\\u2018tasks\\\\u2019 that make up the majority of our interactions with our children. They offer us endless possibilities for connection that we might miss if we are not really present, even though we may be physically going through the motions. You may come to experience these \\'little\\' moments as \\'precious moments\\' not to be missed.\\\\nWhen we find ourselves in challenging situations, it can be helpful to take a step back and ask ourselves, \\\\\"What is Most Important Now?\\\\\"\\\\nIn such situations, when we take a moment to reflect on this, we may open ourselves up to possibilities that may otherwise may be hidden by the stress and worry of what we think should be happening.\\\\nHere is my moment to practice, to notice the sensations arising in my body, the racing thoughts of questioning the past and forecasting into the future. I take a few deep breaths and reflect on \\\\\"What is most important now?\\\\\" And I realize, it is helping my baby get to sleep. Not folding laundry, not cooking, not being on the Internet, not even formally meditating. Not only is helping my baby sleep the most important thing, but it is also the reality I\\'m faced with. I can struggle with the situation and wish it was different, but that just doesn\\'t change it (and never really does). Or it can be right here, present with the situation I am in and figure out what is needed in this moment, right now - not for tomorrow or not even for the next hour.\\\\nOnce I took a step back, and a few breaths, I was able to let go of questioning the past and worrying about the future and focus on the task at hand. I also became aware that I was super-tired and needing support this particular night, so I called my partner to come home from a class and help put our son to bed... I followed shortly thereafter.\\\\nAt the end of each day, invite yourself to reflect on a positive moment that you had with your child or children. Even if it has been a particularly challenging day (especially if it has been so), bring to mind a pleasant moment that you had with your child or children - or reflect on something that you appreciated about your child or children today.\\\\nIt can be all too easy for our minds to hold on to the challenges that we experience in our day-to-day lives, overshadowing the moments of joy. Intentionally reflecting on the pleasant moments can support us in re-connecting with and remembering the joy and pleasure we share with our children each and every day.\\\\n\\\\\"Instead of positive experiences washing through you like a sieve, they\\'ll collect in implicit memory deep down in your brain.\\\\\" (Rick Hanson, \\\\\"just one thing: developing a buddha brain one simple practice at a time).\\\\nLovingkindess is a practice of cultivating compassion, both for ourselves and others. It can be easy to feel love and compassion when people are doing things we like or acting in ways that we want them to. But it can be challenging during those times when people aren\\\\u2019t necessarily acting how we would like them to or when we are faced with aspects of ourselves that we find hard to accept.\\\\nJust like we practice the cultivation of mindfulness / present-moment awareness, we can also engage in practice to cultivate compassion, patience and acceptance for ourselves and others. This practice is known as Metta or lovingkindness practice.\\\\nIt involves the repetition of phrases, and tapping into the intention behind them. Depending on how much time you have to practice, you may choose elements of this practice, for example, offering lovingkindness to yourself as a caregiver, or perhaps focusing on offering lovingkindness to your child.\\\\nWith this practice, it is also important to notice if an attachment to an outcome arises; to notice that and let it be. The purpose of the practice is to support us in developing compassion for ourselves and for others, rather than expecting others to change as a result of our practice. You can do the entire practice in one sitting or perhaps focus on a specific section if that feels most relevant.\\\\nBelow is a sample of lovingkindess phrases that you might use. It is not the actual words or phrases that are most important, but rather the intention behind them, so please feel free to use phrases that resonate most with you.\\\\nFor the first part of this practice, bringing into your mind\\\\u2019s eye, the image of your child (or one of your children) during a time in which you felt very connected to them. Perhaps it was a pleasant experience that you shared, or maybe a moment when you felt very proud of them... a time when you felt a lot of love - positive feelings towards your child. While holding this image of your child in your mind, repeat silently the phrases of lovingkindness.\\\\nWhen you are ready, invite an image of the same child during a difficult time. Perhaps you are feeling angry or disappointed or frightened with something that they have said or done \\\\u2013 or saddened by a choice they have made. Perhaps it was a time of conflict between the two of you. While holding this image of your child in your mind, again repeat the same phrases of lovingkindness. See if you can invite yourself to generate a sense of compassion, even in the midst of a challenging time. Notice if any struggles arise in the mind, or in the body, when saying these phrases. Perhaps feelings of righteousness or a reluctance to let go. See if you might invite yourself back to the phrases. Practicing holding on to compassion, amidst the difficult times, which are bound to happen.\\\\nNow, bringing an image of yourself, as a parent or caregiver into your mind\\\\u2019s eye during a time when you felt very positive about yourself as a parent or caregiver. Perhaps at a time when you were feeling connected, responsive, attuned to your child\\\\u2026 pleased with yourself in your role as parent/caregiver. While holding this image of yourself in your mind, repeat the phrases of lovingkindness.\\\\nIf you don\\\\u2019t remember the exact words, that is okay, again, it is the intention behind the repetition of the phrases that is the goal.\\\\nNow, bringing into your mind\\\\u2019s eye an image of yourself as a parent/caregiver during a time when you were not so pleased with yourself in a situation. Perhaps this is a time that you \\'flipped your lid,\\' when you responded to your child in a way that you wish you hadn\\\\u2019t. We can often be very hard on ourselves in such moments, very judgmental, and forget that in these situations, we are doing the best that we can. We may see another parent in a challenging situation, and our heart goes out to them. Yet, when we find ourselves in a similar situation, we may be very hard on ourselves. Seeing what it might be like to bring compassion to ourselves even during those times when we may be stressed, maxed out, not necessarily at our best. Not only reserving kindness and compassion for those times when we are \\\\u201con,\\\\u201d being kind and gentle and forgiving with ourselves when we may be having a hard time.\\\\nRepeat the same lovingkindness phrases while holding onto this image of ourselves.\\\\nIf you find this very challenging, and notice judgement creeping in, perhaps bring into your mind\\\\u2019s eye is slightly less difficult or \\\\u2018loaded\\\\u2019 situation and see if that might support the cultivation of compassion towards yourself.\\\\nNow, bringing in image of your entire family together, whatever \\\\u2018family\\\\u2019 means to you. Repeating the lovingkindness phrases, sending love and compassion to yourself and your family together.\\\\nFinally, offering these wishes of loving kindness to all families everywhere.\\\\nSchedule time to just be with your children, with no agenda in mind. Follow their lead and see where it takes you. So much of our time is scheduled, rushing from one place to another, whether it be work, school, extra-curricular activities... Invite yourself, even if for 5 minutes a day, to just hang out with your child or children. Gently observing what they are interested in, and engaging when they invite you in to their activities. Otherwise, just sitting back and observing them. Imagine what they might be thinking and feeling - what\\'s going on in their world. You might even on occasion, wonder what they might be thinking or feeling. Observing your child engaged in an activity of their choice is actually a simple, yet profound way to contribute to building their self-esteem.\\\\nComing into a comfortable sitting position and bringing your awareness to your breathing.\\\\nInviting an image of your child (or one of your children if you have more than one) into your mind\\\\u2019s eye, seeing them completely. What are qualities of your child that stand out to you as you bring awareness to them in your mind\\\\u2019s eye? How would you describe them - their true nature? What are some qualities that make up their true nature? (loving, active, strong-willed, sensitive, etc.).\\\\nAs you bring awareness to these qualities of your child, notice what you might feel in your body \\\\u2013 any physical sensations (warmth, tightness, etc.).\\\\nBringing awareness to any thoughts that may arise as you reflect on your child\\\\u2019s True Nature. Also allowing whatever feelings show up to be present, not needing to do anything with them, but noticing them.\\\\nNext, inviting yourself to bring to mind a situation where a conflict may have arisen between yourself and your child \\\\u2013 when they may have been asserting an aspect of their True Nature that may not have fit with what you were hoping for in that situation. Bring this scene to mind as vividly as you can, recalling as best you can what feelings you had at the time. What thoughts came up? What body sensations were present?\\\\nNow, bringing awareness to what you notice in this moment as you reflect on this conflict. What thoughts, feelings and body sensations, if any arise? Perhaps frustration with your child, or with yourself as a parent, perhaps judgment, perhaps tension.\\\\nSeeing if you can simply sit with those emotions and thoughts and sensations as they slip into your awareness, without doing anything but allowing them to be in your presence. If you notice the urge to rationalize them or make them stop, simply acknowledge that as well and let it be within your awareness. If there are any judgments that accompany your thoughts and feelings, bringing awareness to those as well. Again, not needing to do anything with these thoughts and emotions, just letting them be, come and go, in and out of awareness. Practicing being an observer to our inner experiences, without having to act upon them.\\\\nOften, in challenging moments, we react automatically when difficult thoughts or feelings or judgments arise, and yet when we can be mindful of them and observe them, we can make more of a choice of how to respond. With practice, we can learn to observe our thoughts, feelings and body sensations and to not have them dictate our reactions.\\\\nWhen we bring more awareness to our inner experience when in relationship with our children, we open up the possibility of rich learning - about what\\\\u2019s going on for them, perhaps seeing the situation through their eyes, and, as such, honouring their True Nature, while also remaining connected, both with them and with ourselves.\\\\nThis simple practice is a way to bring breath awareness and stillness with your child. Children are so attuned to their parents that they can sense when we are stressed, upset, happy, calm, etc. Here is an opportunity to provide them the opportunity to experience your calm presence. You could do this practice if there has been a stressful interaction, you have had a stressful day and are feeling stressed out or just anytime when you are with your child.\\\\nYou can do this practice when holding or wearing your baby, when your child is sitting on your lap or simply when you are with your child. You don\\'t even have to tell them that you are doing anything special!\\\\nSimply checking in with your breath and bringing your awareness to it. What is it like in this moment? Can you be intentional about your breathing? What do you notice about the contact / interaction with your child when you slow down and bring your awareness to your breath? What do you notice about any response form your child (if any)?\\\\nIf it feels right for you, perhaps even quietly, in your own mind reciting the phrases offered by Thich Nhat Han.\\\\n\\\\\"Breathing in, I feel calm. Breathing out, I feel at ease.\\\\\"\\\\nWhat a perfect way to soak up the summer, by taking a moment to slow down and really linger in a pleasant experience. Drink in this experience, with all your senses, with all your being. Whether it be lying on a beach, walking with a loved one, smelling a flower on a morning stroll, feeling the wind on your face as you ride your bicycle, savouring a yummy frozen treat with your family, or a warm summer front-porch evening, watching the neighbourhood go by. Not grasping. Not clinging. Just fully showing up to what is already occurring. Throughout your day, invite yourself to slow down and really experience these moments, even for a few seconds. By doing this, they are more likely to make it into your memory.\\\\nInvite yourself at the end of the day to recall one of these experiences. What body sensations, emotions, thoughts do you recall as you reflect on the experience? Intentionally reflecting on positive experiences not only feels good, but actually strengthens the positive neural pathways in our brain.\\\\nYou can even do this with your family. Each person can reflect on and share an experience they basked in that day. The more details the better to really make it stick in your memory. What a feel-good way to train our brains to become more aware of all the good around us.\\\\nCheck out Rick Hanson for more ideas on bringing more good into our lives.\\\\nFeel free to bask in ALL of the goodness offered by each of the seasons.\\\\nTo begin this meditation, start by finding a comfortable, seated position. Allow your attention to be directed inwards. Checking in with how you are feeling in your body and in your mind. Bringing a sense of acceptance to whatever your experience may be \\\\u2013 because it is already here.\\\\nFor the second part of this meditation, direct your awareness to your breath. Observing the full of cycle of your breath from the beginning of the inhalation to the end of the exhalation. Perhaps saying to yourself \\\\u2013 \\\\\"inhaling\\\\\" as you inhale and \\\\u201cexhaling\\\\u201d as you exhale. No need to manipulate the breath in any way, just simply staying with one point of focus. And when distractions tug at your awareness, gently guide your attention back to the breath.\\\\nNow that you have taken some time to settle into the meditation, see if you can bring an image or your child or your children into your mind\\\\u2019s eye. See what it is like to hold this image. Is it pleasant, or unpleasant or neutral? As you continue to hold this image, see if you can evoke feelings of loving kindness towards your children. To help you in this practice, you may try bringing forth phrases that capture your deepest feelings. Some phrases you may try are the following: May you be happy; May you be healthy; May you live in peace.\\\\nFor the next part of this practice, see if you can direct the same feelings of loving kindness towards yourself as a parent. Recognizing the qualities of yourself that your children benefit from having you as a parent: your commitment, your compassion, your caring, your vulnerability. And recognizing how at times we may feel uncertain or judged, particularly from ourselves when faced with difficult situations. Knowing that as parents we do our best to be the \\\\\"good enough parent\\\\\", to borrow a phrase from D.W. Winnicott. We accept that we will make some mistakes and perfection is impossible. So as you offer yourself loving kindness, find phrases that resonate with you: May I be happy, May I be healthy, May I be at peace, May I do the best I can as I care for my children.\\\\nAnd now bring your entire family into your mind\\\\u2019s eye. As you hold this image, again evoke feelings of loving kindness with the phrases that you have chosen: May we all be happy; May we all be healthy; May we all be at peace; May we live in ease and enjoy our lives together.\\\\nFor the final part of the meditation, bring to mind all families everywhere, in every part of the country, the world. And now bring feelings of loving kindness and compassion to all families, knowing that all parents and their children face struggles in living a peaceful, harmonious life. May all families be happy; May all families by healthy; and May all families live a harmonious and joyous life together.\\\\nIntention One: I will bring my entire creative genius to the work of mindful parenting.\\\\nIntention Two: I will see parenting as a spiritual discipline, meaning that it provides me with every necessary opportunity to cultivate wisdom and open heartedness in myself, so that I may come to know and express my true nature and share what is best in me with my children and with the world.\\\\nIntention Three: I will cultivate mindfulness and discernment in my daily life, especially with my children, using an awareness of my breathing to ground me in the present moment.\\\\nIntention Four: I will make every effort to see who my children actually are, and to remember to accept them for who they are at every age, rather than be blinded by my own expectations and fears. By making a commitment to live my own life fully and to work at seeing and accepting myself as I am, I will be better able to accord a similar acceptance to my children. In this way I can help them to grow and to realize their full potential as unique beings.\\\\nIntention Five: I will make every effort to see things from each child\\\\u2019s point of view and understand what my children\\\\u2019s needs are, and to meet them as best I can.\\\\nIntention Six: I will use whatever comes up in my own life and in the lives of my children, including the darkest and most difficult times, as \\\\u201cgrist for the mill,\\\\u201d to grow as a human being so that I am better able to understand my children, their soul needs, and what is required of me as a parent.\\\\nIntention Seven: I will pull these intentions into my heart, and commit myself to putting them into practice as best I can, every day, and in appropriate ways that feel right to me and that honour children\\\\u2019s sovereignty, and my own.\\\\nLike the \\'Seven Intentions\\', these twelve exercises are by Myla & Jon Kabat-Zinn.\\\\nExercise One: Try to imagine the world from your child\\'s point of view, purposefully letting go of your own. Do this every day for at least a few moments to remind you of who this child is and what he or she faces in the world.\\\\nExercise Two: Imagine how you appear and sound from your child\\'s point of view, i.e., having you as a parent today, in this moment. How might this modify how you carry yourself in your body and in space, how you speak, what you say? How do you want to relate to your child in this moment?\\\\nExercise Three: Practice seeing your children as perfect just the way they are. See if you can stay mindful of their sovereignty from moment to moment, and work at accepting them as they are when it is hardest for you to do so.\\\\nExercise Four: Be mindful of your expectations of your children and consider whether they are truly in your child\\'s best interest. Also, be aware of how you communicate those expectations and how they affect your children.\\\\nExercise Five: Practice altruism, putting the needs of your children above your own whenever possible. Then see if there isn\\'t some common ground, where your true needs can also be met. You may be surprised at how much overlap is possible, especially if you are patient, and strive for balance.\\\\nExercise Six When you feel lost, or at a loss, remember to stand still, as in David Wagoner\\'s poem: \\\\\"The forest breathes...\\\\\" Listen to what it is saying; \\\\\"The forest knows/Where you are. You must let it find you...\\\\\" Meditate on the whole, by bringing your full attention to the situation, to your child, to yourself, to the family. In doing so, you may go beyond thinking, even good thinking, and perceive intuitively, with the whole of your being (your feelings, intuition, body, mind, and soul) what really needs to be done. If that is not clear in any moment, maybe the best thing is to not do anything until it becomes clearer. Sometimes it is good to remain silent.\\\\nExercise Seven: Try embodying silent presence. This will grow out of both formal and informal mindfulness practice over time, if you attend to how you carry yourself and what you project in body, mind, and speech. Listen carefully.\\\\nExercise Eight: Learn to live with tension without losing your own balance. In Zen and the Art of Archery, Herrigel describes how he was taught to stand at the point of highest tension effortlessly without shooting the arrow. At the right moment, the arrow mysteriously shoots itself. Do this by practicing moving into any moment, however difficult, without trying to change anything and without having to have a particular outcome occur. Simply bring your full awareness and presence to this moment. Practice seeing that whatever comes up is \\\\\"workable,\\\\\" if you are willing to stand in this way in the present, trusting your intuition and best instincts. Your child, especially when young, needs you to be a center of balance and trustworthiness, a reliable landmark by which he or she can take a bearing within his or her own landscape. Arrow and target need each other. Forcing doesn\\'t help. They will find each other better through wise attention and patience.\\\\nExercise Nine: Apologize to your child when you have betrayed a trust in even a little way. Apologies are healing. An apology demonstrates that you have thought about a situation and have come to see it more clearly, or perhaps more from your child\\'s point of view. But we have to be mindful of being \\\\\"sorry\\\\\" too often. It loses its meaning if we are always saying it, or make regret into a habit. Then it can become a way for us not to take responsibility for our actions. Be aware of this. Cooking in remorse on occasion is a good meditation. Don\\'t shut off the stove until the meal is ready.\\\\nExercise Ten: Every child is special, and every child has special needs. Each sees in an entirely unique way. Hold an image of each child in your heart. Drink in their being, wishing them well.\\\\nExercise Eleven: There are very important times when we need to practice being clear and strong and unequivocal with our children. Let this come as much as possible out of awareness and generosity and discernment, rather than out of fear, self-righteousness, or the desire to control. Mindful parenting does not mean being overindulgent, neglectful, or weak; nor does it mean being rigid, domineering, and controlling.\\\\nExercise Twelve: The greatest gift you can give your child is your self. This means that part of your work as a parent is to keep growing in self-knowledge and in awareness. We have to be grounded in the present moment to share what is deepest and best in ourselves. This is ongoing work, but it can be furthered by making a time for quiet contemplation in whatever ways feel comfortable to us. We only have right now. Let us use it to its best advantage, for our children\\'s sake, and for our own.\\\\nLearn more about eating mindfully as a family.\"}\\n',\n",
              " '{\"text\": \"Our last holiday makers left on the 1st of October and (barring any last minute bookings) we have officially ended our second Spanish (and occasionally French) mountain biking season, meaning no more guiding until 2011. What a season it has been! I wanted to take the time to write a summary of the season and thank everyone who made it such a great year. It\\\\u2019s also an excuse to put up some of the pictures I took during September.\\\\nOur first big step forward for 2010 was the purchase of the new BasqueMTB van, which swallows 9 people and 9 bikes and gives us a lot more flexibility for holidays. I returned back to Scotland for Christmas with my parents while Amaia sorted out the details on our van and I returned in January to my new ride! We have spent most of the season discussing how we are going to decorate the outside of the van, and by the time we finally decided we were too busy to put it into the garage to get the stickers done! Look out for a post early 2011 with the new van design.\\\\nReturning to Spain at the end of January was great after spending 4 weeks in a frozen (but beautiful) Scotland and it was great to be riding in short sleeves again! Winter is also prime trail finding season because there is less vegetation, meaning the trails are easier to spot, and we got right down to putting some new trails in the guiding bank. They came thick and fast, \\\\u201cThe Blue Pill\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cThe Hives\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cRocky Hell Road\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cEtch-a-Sketch\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cKarrikas\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cCross the Streams\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cCassius Clay\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cBroken Bridges\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cThe Canal Epic\\\\u201d etc etc. It\\\\u2019s hard to believe but I think we doubled our trail count in a few months. We have also added some new trails during September and thanks to everyone who I tested them out on and gave me feedback. We now have \\\\u201cStinky Goat Track\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cThe Joshua Tree\\\\u201c, \\\\u201cLas Minas\\\\u201d and a few more that we haven\\\\u2019t named yet!\\\\nSo along came the 21st of March and our first holidays. We were kept ticking over in March, April and May but it was June before we were busy. June also saw our first return customers (a continuing theme), with Dave returning and bringing his friends. What a week we had, there were floods all over Spain and people were dying in the Pyrenees! It was so wet, and although we managed to search out dryer places to bike we had a couple of cold, wet days. What a pity. Guys, you didn\\\\u2019t see the best of the place and the offer still stands for a cut price week next season!\\\\nThe next week we were back to normal Spanish service and the sun shone and the trails quickly dried out! We had a group out from Glasgow and it was all suntan cream and cold beers. The season really continued from there with July being fully booked, with some more returning customers and a great week with a family of six! They have already booked 2 weeks in 2011 which is fantastic and we are looking forward to it already. July also saw our first major injury. We have had a lot of cuts and bruises and even a sprained ankle but this was different with a broken leg. I have already written about it so won\\\\u2019t dwell on it apart from saying hoping that Lynne makes a full recovery and gets back on her bike soon. I also won\\\\u2019t share the pictures that I was sent of the scars after her operation!\\\\nSo then we worked pretty solidly from the last part of August until the 1st of October, guiding for 5 weeks in a row. That was my longest continuous period of guiding and I worked out that I rode about 30,000m of vertical over that time and about 500km horizontally. That\\\\u2019s including me riding up to get the van at the end of the day (and sometimes at lunchtime too) so our guests did 30km of descending and around 20km of climbing over that time! The great news is that I am feeling pretty fresh, there wasn\\\\u2019t a day when it felt like chore to go riding, and indeed I plan to get out for some DH with some friends this evening!\\\\nNow it\\\\u2019s the end of the season. It\\\\u2019s a strange feeling. I\\\\u2019m a bit sad that I won\\\\u2019t be guiding until March 2011 but it will be nice to get out and do some riding with friends; people I haven\\\\u2019t had time to see over the last few months. I also intend to get to the local freeride spots with some local French guys, something that I haven\\\\u2019t had time to do and also I consider it a bit risky during the main season. There is also a big trip to the Spanish Pyrenees at the end of the month, exploring an area where we hope to offer some holidays from October \\\\u2013 March. It\\\\u2019s a big area with lots of scope for technical big mountain days and is in the south facing Pyrenees so is warmer during winter, (although too hot in summer!). If anyone is interested in this then we will be offering holidays in early 2011 so give me a shout to register your interest.\\\\nAll that remains is to say thanks to everyone who has made this season all that it was, most importantly that is everyone who has visited BasqueMTB, I\\\\u2019ve really enjoyed meeting all of you and showing you around our hills and towns. I\\\\u2019d also like to thank all the local people who have helped, shown me trails or kept me company while I explore. Also all the people who have helped me get the word out about BasqueMTB, lent a hand or offered advice. Very much appreciated, thanks!\\\\nThis entry was posted el Monday, October 4th, 2010 at 10:40 am\\\\tand is classified as Trail.

              " '{\"text\": \"For the first time scientists have begun mapping one of the remotest areas of Antarctica.\\\\nThe area, called the Recovery Catchment, sits halfway between the South Pole and the Halley VI research station on the Brunt Ice Shelf in northeast Antarctica.\\\\nLast year researchers proposed that the Recovery Catchment, which sits above a major glacial basin, could be affected by rising ocean temperatures as early as the end of this century.\\\\nIt\\'s thought that the dynamics and flow speeds of the ice streams and glaciers underneath the Catchment could be affected by warming ocean waters, which would have a major impact as it\\'s thought to contain enough ice to raise global sea levels by as much as three metres.\\\\nWhile this inaccessible location is currently stable, it has only been assessed in the past by satellite data, so scientists don\\'t know how changes in climate and temperature will affect it.\\\\nThe ICEGRAV project - a major international collaboration between UK, US, Danish, Norwegian and Argentinian scientists - aims to explore the Recovery Catchment to understand how vulnerable it is to changes in the surrounding ocean and climate.\\\\n\\\\\"Our aim was to explore one of the last frontiers in Antarctica - the Recovery Catchment. We need to understand the underlying topography as this will affect how the area responds to warming oceans,\\\\\" says Dr Fausto Ferraccioli of NERC\\'s British Antarctic Survey (BAS), one of the researchers on the project. \\\\\"If the bedrock dips inland, away from where the ice sheet meets the sea, it could cause warm water to enter the system and create something called marine ice-sheet instability. If that happens then there\\'s nothing to stop the ice sheet from retreating.\\\\\"\\\\nICEGRAV also hopes to understand whether there are large lakes beneath the area, similar to Lake Ellsworth in West Antarctica. These lakes, known as the Recovery Lakes, could be the largest in Antarctica. Existence of the lakes, first seen in satellite imagery, was brought into question last year when Norwegian researchers on the ground found no evidence for water.\\\\nThe preliminary findings are being presented this afternoon at the annual American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting by Ferraccioli and colleagues from the Danish National Space Institute and the Norwegian Polar Institute.\\\\nThis new data has been collected by flying one of NERC\\'s Twin Otter planes 30,000km across the area to measure variations in gravity, ice thickness and magnetism. The survey was based out of Argentina\\'s Belgrano research station, from a remote field location and from the latest state-of-the-art research station in Antarctica, Halley VI, which is operated by BAS.\\\\n\\\\\"Preliminary results from our survey suggest that there\\'s a lot of water there. But subglacial lakes are not the only form of water; it\\'s possible that there are shallower bodies of water that don\\'t form distinct lakes. So now there\\'s the question of how continuous are these features?\\\\\" Ferraccioli says.\\\\nIf these lakes exist, they could provide lubrication for the ice sheet, which would make it more prone to change.\\\\nThe team are also curious about the area\\'s geology as less than one per cent of the rocks in East Antarctica are accessible.\\\\n\\\\\"We know from studies in West Antarctica that the geology beneath the ice sheet plays an important role in controlling ice flow, determining where fast flows occur, the topography and the geothermal temperature. These are all bits and pieces of the puzzle that we need to complete in order to fully comprehend the makeup of East Antarctica and how the ice sheet will react to changes around it,\\\\\" says Ferraccioli.\\\\nThe nearby Shackleton mountain range is made up of scraps of ocean floor - remnants of an ocean that once separated Africa from East Antarctica - formed 500 million years ago when the continents collided to form the supercontinent Gondwana. Yet just north of these mountains, rocks from the Rodina supercontinent are found that are over 1\\\\u00b71 billion years old.\\\\n\\\\\"Our hypotheses about where mountain belts occur in Antarctica from supercontinent collisions rely on these two very small outcrops in East Antarctica,\\\\\" explains Ferraccioli. \\\\\"This new survey, including variations in magnetism and gravity, will help us to understand and start discussing how Antarctica fits into the supercontinent puzzle.\\\\\"\"}\\n',\n",

              " '{\"text\": \"Kentucky Revised Code. Legislative Research Commission.\\\\nThe Kentucky Military Heritage Commission, until recently, was a little-known state agency. Over the past week, the Commission has received quite a bit of news, both locally and nationally, as Lexington considers what to do with two statutes presently standing in the public square.\\\\nYesterday\\'s unanimous vote by the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Council was to \\\\\"support the relocation\\\\\" of the two statutes, a decision that will ultimately be made by the Kentucky Military Heritage Commission.\\\\nThe two statues at issue are of John C. Breckinridge and John Hunt Morgan. Both men were slaveowners who took up arms against the United States during the Civil War. Both men came from prominent, white Lexington families who were instrumental in Lexington\\'s 19th century growth and prominence (that familial success being achieved largely through the involuntary toil of slaves owned by the respective families).\\\\nThe statue of John C. Breckinridge in its original location. Kentucky Digital Library.\\\\nBreckinridge was a Lexingtonian, a Vice President of the United States under President Buchanan, and then a U.S. Senator from Kentucky. But Breckinridge was expelled from the Senate upon joining the Confederate Army in 1861. He received a commission as a brigadier general; on February 7, 1865, Breckinridge would become the final Secretary of the Army for the Confederate States of America.\\\\nWhat followed enhanced the Breckinridge legend and surrounded an already appealing figure with even more romance. Here was a daring, charismatic Southern leader fleeing from Union pursues. Swarms of mosquitoes, ticks, sand-flies, and other insects of every description tormented him as he fled through Florida. In a boat too small to lie down in, the party rowed along the rivers of the area for days. Alligators surrounded them; rain soaked their food; hunger reduced them to eating turtle eggs, sour oranges, green limes, and coconuts. ... Needing a larger boat to cross to Cuba, the \\\\\"sailors\\\\\" commandeered at gunpoint a larger craft. ... The sloop No Name sailed into Cardenas, Cuba, on 11 June 1865. General Breckinridge - bronzed, unshaven, his feet swollen by salt water but the long mustache still intact, wearing a blue flannel suit open at the neck and an old slouch hat - was welcomed as a conquering hero.\\\\nJohn Cabell Breckinridge remained on the lam through the remainder of the 1860s until after President Johnson had issued him amnesty; Breckinridge died in 1875. The statue commemorating Breckinridge was erected by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1887 in the middle of Cheapside Park. In 2010, the statue was relocated so that it fronted Main Street making space for the Fifth Third Bank Pavilion. The bronze statute rests upon a granite pedestal, with each \\\\\"being of equal height\\\\\" according to the 1997 National Register nomination form.\\\\nStatue of the John Hunt Morgan. Author\\'s collection.\\\\nJohn Hunt Morgan was born in Alabama, but his mother was raised in Lexington before marrying an Alabaman. John Hunt Morgan returned to Lexington for two years as a student at Transylvania before being suspended for dueling. During the Mexican War, Morgan achieved the rank of lieutenant in the United States Army.\\\\nJohn Hunt Morgan is best known, however, as the \\\\\"Thunderbolt of the Confederacy.\\\\\" He joined the Confederate Army in early 1862, and, following the Battle of Shiloh, began a series of raids. His raids were intended to disrupt Union supply lines and communications. His guerrilla tactics had as much, if not more, effect on citizens as it did on Union forces. In one raid, much of Cynthiana was burned. Morgan\\'s actions were unauthorized and, in 1864, he was killed by Union troops during a raid in Tennessee. Some persuasively argue that his death was akin to \\\\\"suicide by police,\\\\\" as he desired to neither be captured by Union forces nor court martialed by the Confederacy.\\\\nHopemont, now known as the Hunt-Morgan House, was the home of Morgan\\'s maternal grandfather, John Wesley Hunt; it was built in 1814 and is located in Lexington\\'s Gratz Park neighborhood. John Wesley Hunt was the first millionaire west of the Allegheny Mountains. Henrietta Hunt, John Hunt Morgan\\'s mother, inherited the home. Although it was his mother\\'s home, John Hunt Morgan never lived here.\\\\nThe statue of General Morgan was erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1911. New York sculptor Pompeo Coppini believed that \\\\\"no hero should bestride a mare,\\\\\" so he sculpted Morgan atop a stallion. Morgan\\'s horse, Black Bess, was not.\\\\nThese two sculptures are located at Cheapside, the site of one of the South\\'s largest slave markets. Here, families were torn apart. Wives were separated from their husbands; children torn from the arms of their mothers. And, there can be no doubt, slaves owned by the Breckinridge and Hunt-Morgan families were sold on the very ground now memorializing these two men who rose up in arms against the United States.\\\\nThe Kentucky Military Heritage Commission was established in 2002 and is charged with \\\\\"maintaining a registry of Kentucky military heritage sites and objects significant to the military history of the Commonwealth.\\\\\" Sites accepted onto the registry \\\\\"cannot be damaged or destroyed, removed or significantly altered, other than for repair or renovation, without the written consent of the commission.\\\\\"\\\\nThe commission consists of the Adjutant General, the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Director of the Kentucky Historical Society, the Director of the Commission on Military Affairs and the Commissioner of the Department of Veteran\\'s Affairs.\\\\nBoth the Breckinridge and the Morgan monuments are included on the registry. As a result, their removal, destruction, or alteration, must have the written approval of this Commission.\\\\nThe registry of sites under the purview of the Kentucky Military Heritage Commission, as of January 2016, is available online (Word file). According to the KMHC, there are 230 \\\\\"eligible\\\\\" military sites and objects eligible for inclusion on the commission\\'s registry; only 25* sites or objects, however, are listed.\\\\nIn Fayette County, there are 11 sites/objects identified although only 4 appear on the registry. Those four are the Breckinridge Monument, the Morgan Monument, the Confederate Soldier Monument (erected 1893), and the Confederate Monument (Ladies Memorial) (erected 1873). In other words, all 4 sites/objects on the registry (1) relate to the Civil War and (2) memorialize Confederate causes or individuals.\\\\nIt cannot be ignored, by the nominations submitted to the Kentucky Military Heritage Commission have historically been more about the preservation of Confederate/Lost Cause history than anything else.\\\\nOf the 12 Civil War related sites/objects on the registry, 10 are connected to the Confederacy. That\\'s 83%. Now, keep in mind the following: Kentucky never seceded from the Union (we were, however, a house divided). Both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were born in Kentucky. More Kentuckians fought and died for the preservation of the Union than did for her destruction.\\\\nSome have suggested that the removal of the statues in Lexington and across the country is a revision of history. I would argue to the contrary; the history memorialized by the Morgan and Breckinridge monuments does not properly tell of what truly transpired. What is more, it is a glorification of the worst among us. Furthermore, the history contained in these monuments is, itself, a revisionist history.\\\\nThe conservative racial, social, political, and gender values inherent in Confederate symbols and the Lost Cause greatly appealed to many white Kentuckians, who despite their devotion to the Union had never entered the war in order to free slaves. In a postwar world where racial boundaries were in flux, the Lost Cause and the conservative potluck that with it seemed not only a comforting reminder of a past free of late nineteenth-century insecurities but also a way to reinforce contemporary efforts to maintain white supremacy.\\\\nThere was no outward sign of public objection to the man who had brought destruction to so many civilians during the war and no mention of the irony that the state on which he had inflicted so much damages and the state whose people he had robbed of thousands of dollars in species and horseflesh had spent many thousands more to honor him.\\\\nJames Klotter also examined Kentucky\\'s nostalgic shift toward embracing the Lost Cause in his book Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox 1900-1950. He wrote that in the final decades of the 1800s, \\\\\"Kentucky turned more and more sympathetic to the Lost Cuase.\\\\\" Klotter noted that in 1902, a Confederate Home was built for Southern veterans and funds were appropriated for Confederate graves at Perryville. In 1910, the state legislature appropriate funds to the United Daughters of the Confederacy for the completion of the Morgan statue now at issue. In 1912, the state purchased the birthplace of Jefferson Davis. In 1926, Robert E. Lee\\'s birthday became a state holiday (and its not the only Confederate state holiday we celebrate in Kentucky).\\\\nIronically, Kentucky had no need for a religion based on the Lost Cause, nor for a way to overcome the psychology of a tragic defeat - as did southerners generally - because most Kentuckians, and the state itself, had been on the winning side. Yet, they wholeheartedly embraced the mythology and the moonlight and magnolia image.\\\\nMuch of the rewriting of history occurred in the waning years of the 19th century and the opening decades of the 20th century. The present discussion on removing the statues is not an attempt to hide history, but to tell a more complete and honest version of America\\'s history.\"}\\n',\n",

It\\\\u2019s usually pretty obvious from the day-to-day inter-action with your boss and the feedback from customers how well you\\\\u2019re performing, what you need to do more of and where you might need to pull yourself up a bit.\\\\nThe problem with this ad hoc approach however is that it\\\\u2019s\\\\u2026 well all a bit ad-hoc really. Yes, you almost certainly do have some kind of formal annual appraisal \\\\u2013 but the reality is your manager probably hasn\\\\u2019t had time to prepare properly and has just scribbled a few notes about what to discuss on the back of a scrappy bit of paper.\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s also a tendency for what\\\\u2019s been discussed and agreed not to be documented in any consistent way. So although you may have had a really positive conversation about the need for you to go on a particular course or shadow a colleague to build your expertise in a specifc area, it gets lost in the mists of time or pushed aside in favour of more pressing day-to-day operational priorities.\\\\nWhen hard-pressed managers are \\\\u2018fitting appraisals in\\\\u2019 on top of their other commitments, it\\\\u2019s also very easy for inconsistency to creep in across the business. One member of staff gets their performance review done and is rewarded with a pay rise (if they\\\\u2019re very lucky) \\\\u2013 while someone on the other side of the office is still waiting three months later. At best, that individual might feel a bit miffed. At worst, they\\\\u2019ll feel unfairly treated and resentment against colleagues might set in.\\\\nNow I\\\\u2019m not suggesting for a moment that SMEs should stifle their natural tendency to do everything on the hoof and to be highly responsive to what\\\\u2019s happening at the time. The fast pace and ability to act quickly without bureaucracy is one of the joys of working for a small business. But when it comes to performance management, a bit of structure can be positively helpful.\\\\nThanks to the latest technology, that doesn\\\\u2019t mean burying yourself under piles of standard forms and ploughing mechanically through a list of questions that don\\\\u2019t really relate to the individual or the job in hand. Today\\\\u2019s performance management software makes it easy for managers to plan for appraisals, record what\\\\u2019s been discussed and make sure agreed actions don\\\\u2019t slip through the net. Systems can be set up to nudge them when appraisals are due or when it\\\\u2019s time for a quick informal check-in.\\\\nMaking sure these conversations take place on a regular business gives the business a chance to make sure it\\\\u2019s really stretching its employees and using their talents to the full \\\\u2013 and that\\\\u2019s particularly important in a difficult economic climate where SMEs need all their people to be performing to the max.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s also a great way to help build engagement and commitment. Most employees really appreciate the opportunity to sit down and discuss how they feel about the job and to make suggestions about what else they could do to contribute to the success of the business.\\\\nOf course any performance management software system is only as good as the people who are managing it \\\\u2013 but it would be interesting to know how many of the SMEs on the Best Companies list are using technology to help drive performance?\\\\nWhat do you think? Could performance management software help SMEs improve the way they tackle appraisals? What\\\\u2019s your experience been of automating the appraisal process?\\\\nYou may be interested in reading our guide to keeping staff engaged.\\\\nI would like to think so. Still, there are ways to improve!\\\\nHome \\\\u00bb Human Resources Blog \\\\u00bb Are you a great company to work for?\"}\\n',\n",

Thanks everyone for entering and sharing your paper piecing experience and some photos.\\\\nI just learned to quilt a few months ago. I have been doing a lot of 9 patch patterns. I have been wanting to try some different ones but, haven\\\\u2019t found anything that is in easy to understand instructions yet. Stars is one of the ones I really wanna try but when you read it in quilting books sometimes it looks greek. I work full time and have my mother-in-law that helps when I can get up to see her. I have a friend that quilts but we can hardly ever get together cause of my work. (I work with special Needs Kids) So it\\\\u2019s very long hours with some of them. I would love this book or any book to help me futher my quilting experience.\\\\nMy first attempt at paper piecing was approximately six years ago. It didn\\\\u2019t seem so hard at the time. In January I tried again at a class at Road to California. It was like Greek to me. I finally got my saw tooth triangles completed with only one fabric sewn backwards. I\\\\u2019ll try it again, soon I hope. If the learning curve goes down in the next six years I better try before then!\\\\nI began quilting several year ago when I was between jobs but then put it aside as I was pastoring a church full-time. Am now just getting back to it after about 8 years which means the class I took is long faded from my memory. My husband is now partially disabled and has been sewing with me. He has a good eye and can do anything. Thanks to my mother we now have two sewing machines and can work side-by-side. I love star patterns and would a chance to win your book.\\\\nI have never tried paper piecing! For some reason it really intimidates me, just like FMQ did until I tried it recently! I really need to take a deep breath and dive right in. Thanks for the chance!\\\\nMy first experience was confusing. It ended up with messy back side as I didn\\\\u2019t know I should trim during the process. Once I watched free tut on Craftsy my second try went smooth.\\\\nHope to start soon. Gathering pronects \\\\u2013 just need more time!\\\\nI have a wonderful teacher and DS is my first time. Love it.\\\\nI have only made one quilt. I have not yet really got into making all the different things yet! But I am excited to learn and I think that anything that will make it easier or come out right will be worth the knowledge! Thank you for the chance to win!\\\\nI will attempt my first paper piecing at a class with Deb Karasik in two weeks. I\\\\u2019ve been concentrating on building skills one at a time, and enjoy taking classes to learn new techniques.\\\\nAfter enjoying the A4A quilt-along, I did purchase the Paper Piecing Tutorial when it came out to add to my library of techniques.\\\\nMy first time was a hot mess. I\\\\u2019ve played around a little more since then but not much. I\\\\u2019m going to try more when I finish two UFO that are late. Haha!\\\\nPaper piecing? I\\\\u2019ve only done it to make hexagonal designs for cusion covers.\\\\nI\\\\u2019d like to try more so will start to follow your ideas.\\\\nMy first block that I saw quilting done was the Pineapple paper pierced block and that just got me into quilting and taking a sampler quilt class. I love PP and the pineapple block, going to make it for our bed.\\\\nTwo weeks ago my daughter made a special trip to my house to teach me how to paper piece. I purchased the book \\\\u201cVintage Quilt Revival\\\\u201d to learn from. I\\\\u2019ve now made every block in the book once and have completed one top (which is on my long-arm now). I was afraid to try paper piecing because it was just so confusing to me. Obviously, she is a very good teacher since I\\\\u2019ve accomplished so much in such a short time.\\\\nMy advise is don\\\\u2019t be afraid to try something new.\\\\nThe very first thing I ever paper-pieced was a foot and foot pedal pattern by Badskirt. I log cabined it into a bigger block and turned it into a pipe for my friend Katy/imagingermonkey. I have been hooked ever since!

(see below).\\\\nIs this still America when the United Nations orders the Federal government to take action against the State\\'s of Washington and Colorado?\\\\nAgenda 21, and Wisconsin Green Tier, are internationalist tools to eradicate our private property, sovereignty, freedoms, and local governance. You are about to loose your over the counter access to dietary supplements, farmers are being prosecuted for supplying nutrient dense foods in Wisconsin, and they refuse to label foods that are GMO. So unless you are willing to stand and fight this tyranny from foreign shores, start stocking up if you have not already done so. Time is running out so prepare your self and your family to either live as a globalist slave, (happily medicated by the approved drugs of the FDA) or take a stand and truly \\'have your farmer\\'s back\\'.\\\\nThere is a war on for your food and if you do not stand against this tyranny you will be greatly rewarded with three squares and a cot at a FEMA camp coming to your state in the near future.\\\\nS 510 fails on moral, social, economic, political, constitutional, and human survival grounds.1. It puts all US food and all US farms under Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, in the event of contamination or an ill-defined emergency. It resembles theKissinger Plan.\\\\n4. It imposes Codex Alimentarius on the US, a global system of control over food. It allows the United Nations (UN), World Health Organization (WHO), UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the WTO to take control of every food on earth and remove access to natural food supplements. Its bizarre history and its expected impact in limiting access to adequate nutrition (while mandating GM food, GM animals, pesticides, hormones, irradiation of food, etc.) threatens all safe and organic food and health itself, since the world knows now it needs vitamins tosurvive, not just to treat illnesses.\\\\n6. It includes NAIS, an animal traceability program that threatens all small farmers and ranchers raising animals. The UN is participating through the WHO, FAO, WTO, and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in allowing mass slaughter of even heritage breeds of animals and without proof of disease. Biodiversity in farm animals is being wiped out to substitutegenetically engineered animals on which corporations hold patents. Animal diseases can be falsely declared. S 510 includes the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), despite its corrupt involvement in the H1N1 scandal, which is now said to have been concocted by the corporations.\\\\n(NaturalNews) Likely empowered by a U.S. administration that favors the kind of nanny state politics a ruling global entity would no doubt embrace, the head of the United Nations\\' International Narcotics Control Board feels comfortable telling federal officials they should move to challenge measures in Colorado and Washington that decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for adults 21 and over.\\\\nRaymond Yans lectured the voter-approved measures - part of the United States\\' democratic process, something most UN member countries are not familiar with - send \\\\\"a wrong message to the rest of the nation and it sends a wrong message abroad.\\\\\"\\\\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Yans said he would like to see Attorney General Eric Holder \\\\\"take all necessary measures\\\\\" to ensure that marijuana possession remains illegal throughout the United States.\\\\nDoes the UN remember that Obama inhaled?\\\\nCurrently, both states are awaiting the implementation of plans to regulate and tax the drug because officials there are waiting to see if Washington will assert its federal authority in the matter. At present, pot is a Schedule I controlled substance, in the same category as LSD and heroin. The federal Drug Enforcement Administration has said that marijuana has a high potential for abuse and \\\\\"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\\\\\" the New York Times has reported.\\\\nYans\\' outrage makes us wonder here at Natural News if he read reports back in 2006 when then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama told the American Society of Magazine Editors that he did, in fact, smoke marijuana.\\\\n\\\\\"When I was a kid, I inhaled,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"That was the point.\\\\\"\\\\nAlso, is Yans oblivious to the fact that the Netherlands has essentially legalized pot by decriminalizing both its possession and sale? Or that Portugal, in 2001, became the first European country, according to Time magazine, \\\\\"to officially abolish all criminal penalties for personal possession of drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine?\\\\\"\\\\nAt the time, critics of the policy change warned that drug use would skyrocket in a nation where hard drug use was already the highest on the continent. But a subsequent study by the libertarian-leaning CATO Institute in 2009 found no appreciable increase in usage. In fact, in the years after personal possession of drugs was decriminalized, illegal use among teens in Portugal dropped while rates of new HIV infections caused by the sharing of dirty needles also fell. The number of people seeking treatment for drug addition; however, more than doubled - but that figure was an acceptable alternative to incarceration because the Portuguese government had previously determined that treating offenders would be cheaper than jailing them.\\\\n\\\\\"Judging by every metric, decriminalization in Portugal has been a resounding success,\\\\\" Glenn Greenwald, an attorney, author and fluent Portuguese speaker, who conducted the research, told Time. \\\\\"It has enabled the Portuguese government to manage and control the drug problem far better than virtually every other Western country does.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"I think we can learn that we should stop being reflexively opposed when someone else does [decriminalize] and should take seriously the possibility that anti-user enforcement isn\\'t having much influence on our drug consumption,\\\\\" Mark Kleiman, author of the forthcoming When Brute Force Fails: How to Have Less Crime and Less Punishment, and director of the drug policy analysis program at UCLA, told the magazine.\\\\nA number of U.S. politicians have begun to see it that way.\\\\nA year ago, the governors of Washington and Rhode Island - Democrat Christine Gregoire and Republican-turned-Independent Lincoln Chaffee, respectively - petitioned the federal government to reclassify marijuana as a drug with acceptable medical uses, \\\\\"saying the change is needed so states like theirs, which have decriminalized marijuana for medical purposes, can regulate the safe distribution of the drug without risking federal prosecution,\\\\\" the Times said.\\\\n\\\\\"The divergence in state and federal law creates a situation where there is no regulated and safe system to supply legitimate patients who may need medical cannabis,\\\\\" the governors wrote in a letter to Michele M. Leonhart, the DEA administrator.\\\\n\\\\\"What we have out here on the ground is chaos,\\\\\" Gregoire told the Times. \\\\\"And in the midst of all the chaos we have patients who really either feel like they\\'re criminals or may be engaged in some criminal activity, and really are legitimate patients who want medicinal marijuana.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"If our people really want medicinal marijuana, then we need to do it right, we need to do it with safety, we need to do it with health in mind, and that\\'s best done in a process that we know works in this country - and that\\'s through a pharmacist,\\\\\" she added.\\\\nThis Stossel special will blow your mind! The government, especially the EPA, is out of control, as well as local prosecutors trying to make a name for themselves.\\\\n\\\\\"If the jury feels the law is unjust, we recognize the undisputed power of the jury to acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by a judge, and contrary to the evidence... If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or that exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the power to acquit, and the courts must abide by that decision.\\\\\" United States v. Moylan, 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, 1969, 417 F.2d at 1006.\\\\n\\\\\"The people themselves have it in their power effectually to resist usurpation, [the wrongful seizure of authority] without being driven to an appeal to arms. An act of usurpation is not obligatory; it is not law; and any man may be justified in his resistance. Let him be considered as a criminal by the general government, yet only his fellow citizens can convict him; they are his jury, and if they pronounce him innocent, not all the powers of Congress can hurt him; and innocent they certainly will pronounce him, if the supposed law he resisted was an act of usurpation.\\\\\" Elliot\\'s Debates, 94; 2 Bancroft\\'s History of the Constitution, p.267. Quoted in Sparf and Hansen v. U.S., 156 U.S. 51 (1895), Dissenting Opinion: Gray, Shiras, JJ., 144.\\\\nGentlemen, the danger is great, in proportion to the mischief that may happen through our too great credulity. A proper confidence in a court is commendable; but as the verdict (whatever it is) will be yours, you ought to refer no part of your duty to the direction of other persons. If you should be of opinion, that there is no falsehood in Mr. Zenger\\'s papers, you will, nay, (pardon me for the expression) you ought to say so; because you don\\'t know whether others (I mean the Court) may be of that opinion. It is your right to do so, and there is much depending upon your resolution, as well as upon your integrity.\\\\\" Andrew Hamilton\\'s defense of John Peter Zenger, from How. St. Tr. 17:698 (1735) at 703-720.\\\\n\\\\\"...[T]he institution of trial by jury --especially in criminal cases-- has its hold upon public favor chiefly for two reasons. The individual can forfeit his liberty --to say nothing of his life-- only at the hands of those who, unlike any official, are in no wise accountable, directly or indirectly, for what they do, and who at once separate and melt anonymously in the community from which they came. Moreover, since if they acquit their verdict is final, no one is likely to suffer of whose conduct they do not morally disapprove; and this introduces a slack into the enforcement of law, tempering its rigor by the mollifying influence of current ethical conventions. A trial by any jury... preserves both these fundamental elements and a trial by a judge preserves neither...\\\\\" Judge Learned Hand, U.S. ex rel McCann v. Adams, 126 F.2d 774, 775?76 (2nd Circuit, 1942).\\\\n\\\\\"Jury acquittals in the colonial, abolitionist, and post-bellum eras of the United States helped advance insurgent aims and hamper government efforts at social control. Wide spread jury acquittals or hung juries during the Vietnam War might have had the same effect. But the refusal of judges in trials of antiwar protesters to inform juries of their power to disregard the law helped ensure convictions, which in turn frustrated antiwar goals and protected the government from the many repercussions that acquittals or hung juries would have brought.\\\\\" Steven E. Barkan, Jury Nullification in Political Trials, Social Problems, 31, No. 1, 38, October, 1983.\\\\n\\\\\"During the first third of the nineteenth century,.. .judges frequently charged juries that they were the judges of law as well as the fact and were not bound by the judge\\'s instructions. A charge that the jury had the right to consider the law had a corollary at the level of trial procedure: counsel had the right to argue the law --its interpretation and its validity-- to the jury.\\\\\" Note (anon.), The Changing Role of the Jury in the Nineteenth Century, Yale Law Journal 74, 174,(1964).\\\\n\\\\\"...[T]he right of the jury to decide questions of law was widely recognized in the colonies. In 1771, John Adams stated unequivocally that a juror should ignore a judge\\'s instruction on the law if it violates fundamental principles: \\\\\"It is not only...[the juror\\'s] right, but his duty, in that case, to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment, and conscience, though indirect opposition to the direction of the court.\\\\\" There is much evidence of the general acceptance of this principle in the period immediately after the Constitution was adopted.\\\\\" Note (anon.), The Changing Role of the Jury in the Nineteenth Century, Yale Law Journal 74, 173 (1964).\\\\nSee also Judge Van Ness\\' instruction to the jury in United States v. Poyllon, 27 F.Cas. 608, 611 (D.C.D.N.Y. 1812): \\\\\". . . this was in its nature and essence, though not in its form, a penal or criminal action; and they were therefore entitled to judge both of the law and the fact, and that the enforcing act could not apply in this case,\\\\\" and John Marshall\\'s instructions to the jury in United States v. Hutchings, 26 F.Cas. 440, 442 (C.C.D.Vir. 1817): \\\\\"That the jury in a capital case were judges, as well of the law as the fact, and were bound to acquit where either was doubtful.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\"As little can this respondent be justly charged with having, by any conduct of his, endeavored to \\'wrest from the jury their indisputable right to hear argument, and determine upon the question of law as well as the question of fact involved in the verdict which they were required to give.\\' He denies that he did at any time declare that the aforesaid counsel should not at any time address the jury, or did in any manner hinder them from addressing the jury on the law as well as on the facts arising in the case. It was expressly stated, in the copy of his opinion delivered as above set forth to William Lewis, that the jury had a right to determine the law as well as the fact: and the said William Lewis and Alexander James Dallas were expressly informed, before they declared their resolution to abandon the defence, that they were at liberty to argue the law to the jury.\\\\\" United States v. Fries, 9 F.Cas. 924, 934 (D. Pennsylvania, 1800).\\\\n\\\\\"The judge cannot direct a verdict it is true, and the jury has the power to bring in a verdict in the teeth of both law and facts.\\\\\" Mr. Justice Holmes, for the majority in Horning v. District of Columbia, 254 U.S. 135, 138 (1920).\\\\n\\\\\"The facts comprehended in the case are agreed; the only point that remains, is to settle what is the law of the land arising from those facts; and on that point, it is proper, that the opinion of the court should be given. It is fortunate, on the present, as it must be on every occasion, to find the opinion of the court unanimous: we entertain no diversity of sentiment; and we have experienced no difficulty in uniting in the charge, which it is my province to deliver.\\\\n\\\\\"It may not be amiss, here, Gentlemen, to remind you of the good old rule, that on questions of fact, it is the province of the jury, on questions of law, it is the province of the court to decide. But it must be observed that by the same law, which recognizes this reasonable distribution of jurisdiction, you have nevertheless a right to take upon yourselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy. On this, and on every other occasion, however, we have no doubt, you will pay that respect, which is due to the opinion of the court: For, as on the one hand, it is presumed, that juries are the best judges of fact; it is, on the other hand, presumable, that the court are the best judges of the law. But still both objects are lawfully within your power of decision.\\\\\"\\\\nNullification The Rightful Remedy: What do we do when the federal government steps outside of it\\'s Constitutional boundaries? Do we \\'vote the bums out\\' and hope that the new bums limit their own power? Do we ask federal judges in black robes to limit the federal government\\'s power? Thomas Jefferson and James Madison didn\\'t think so, and neither do we. The rightful remedy to federal tyranny rests in the hands of the people and the States that created the federal government in the first place.

In 1967 Rava moved to New York City, and one month later became a member of the group Gas Mask, a group that had one LP on Tonsil Records in 1970. He has played with artists such as Carla Bley, Jeanne Lee, Paul Motian, Lee Konitz and Roswell Rudd. Chiefly an exponent of bebop jazz, Enrico Rava has also played successfully in avant-garde settings. His style may partly recall Kenny Wheeler\\'s in its spareness and lightness of tone, albeit Rava\\'s is harmonically simpler.\\\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s he worked with Pat Metheny, Michel Petrucciani, John Abercrombie, Joe Henderson, Richard Galliano, Miroslav Vitou\\\\u0161, Andrea Centazzo, Joe Lovano, Gil Evans and Cecil Taylor.\\\\nWith trumpeter Paolo Fresu, Rava recorded a series of four CDs on the influence of Bix Beiderbecke, Louis Armstrong, Chet Baker, and Miles Davis (Bix, Pop, Shades of Chet, Play Miles Davis). Also of note are his recordings Rava, L\\'Opera Va\\' and Carmen; his own interpretations of operatic arias and overtures. In 2001, he founded a new quintet with pianist Stefano Bollani, and toured with Gato Barbieri and Aldo Romano.

The reports are time specific in order to depict how the company has performed.

It does not use the past data; in fact it is based on the present performance, future trends and challenges.

This is done so as to enhance and optimize matters related to finance thus aiding in the accomplishment of the company\\\\u2019s goals and objectives.\\\\nThe primary difference between both the types of accounting is quite evident, that management accounting is presented internally whereas financial accounting caters to external stakeholders. Both have significant importance of their own position. Financial is vital for existing and potential investors, while management is crucial for managers to make current and future decisions.\\\\nOptional-Financial reports are legally required, whereas managerial are optional.\\\\nFormat- The report in financial accounting specifically follows a particular format, whereas managerial formats are informal which varies company to company.\\\\nProven Information-Financial reports are kept with utmost precision which is needed to support that the financial statements are correct. Managerial accounting is more about estimates and research data rather than proven records.\\\\nFocus-Financial accounting is primarily based upon past data, oriented towards creation of financial statements which is to be distributed within and outside the company. Managerial accounting is mainly concerned with operational reports focussing on the present and future requirements.\\\\nOwing to its high demand in the market, Accountant jobs in both the fields are available in abundance.

The requirement for a dual signal for T-cell activation and the construction of a fusion protein that prevents engagement of the costimulatory molecules required for this activation has led to a new approach to RA therapy. This approach is mechanistically distinct from other currently used therapies; it targets events early rather than late in the immune cascade, and it results in immunomodulation rather than complete immunosuppression. The fusion protein abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator that avidly binds to the CD80/CD86 ligands on an antigen-presenting cell, resulting in the inability of these ligands to engage the CD28 receptor on the T cell.
